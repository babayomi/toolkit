# üìà Evidence Strength Assessment Guide

Framework for evaluating insight reliability, converting stakeholder input into validated project intelligence, and building credible evidence base that supports strong proposals and community-grounded project design.

---

## üéØ Evidence Assessment Framework

### Why Evidence Strength Matters

**For Project Credibility:**
- Funders require evidence-based analysis to support funding decisions
- Strong evidence base increases proposal success rates
- Credible analysis builds stakeholder confidence in project approach
- Evidence transparency allows others to assess and build on your work

**For Implementation Success:**
- Evidence strength indicates reliability for project planning decisions
- Strong evidence reduces risk of design errors based on weak assumptions
- Graduated evidence levels help prioritize where additional validation needed
- Evidence assessment guides ongoing learning and adaptation strategies

### Evidence Categories System

```
EVIDENCE STRENGTH LEVELS:

STRONG EVIDENCE (E):
- Multiple credible sources confirm finding
- Specific data, examples, or quantitative support provided  
- Consistent across different conversation contexts and settings
- Aligns with credible secondary research where available
- Source has direct experience/knowledge relevant to insight

MODERATE EVIDENCE (E*):
- Several sources mention finding with some variation
- Some specific examples provided but not comprehensive
- Generally consistent with some contextual differences noted
- Partially supported by secondary research or expert opinion
- Source has relevant but not direct experience

VALIDATED ASSUMPTION (A‚ÜíE):
- Original assumption confirmed through stakeholder input
- Community language may differ from original framing
- Additional context provided that strengthens assumption
- Stakeholder validation reduces uncertainty about assumption

WORKING ASSUMPTION (A):
- Single source or limited confirmation
- Logical inference but not definitively supported
- Important hypothesis requiring testing during implementation
- Reasonable belief based on available information but needs validation

CONTRADICTED ASSUMPTION (A‚ÜíX):
- Original assumption challenged by stakeholder input
- Community evidence suggests different reality
- Requires revision of original analysis based on stakeholder insights

## üìã Quick Source Credibility Assessment

### Source Quality Levels
**High Credibility (Most reliable):**
- **Direct experience** with the problem (lives with it, tried solutions)
- **Professional expertise** relevant to the issue (teachers on education, health workers on health)
- **Community representation** (speaks for broader group, perspective confirmed by others)

**Moderate Credibility (Reliable with context):**
- **Relevant but indirect experience** (works with affected population, has professional knowledge)
- **Some positional limitations** (organizational role may influence perspective, recent arrival to community)

**Lower Credibility (Useful when triangulated):**
- **Limited direct knowledge** (brief engagement, knowledge based on assumptions)
- **Potential agenda-driven input** (organizational interest in specific solutions)

### Information Quality Indicators
**Look for insights that:**
- ‚úÖ Provide **concrete examples** rather than general statements
- ‚úÖ Include **specific details** (numbers, timeframes, contexts)
- ‚úÖ Show **consistency** across different conversation contexts
- ‚úÖ Acknowledge **complexity** rather than oversimplifying

## üîç Evidence Triangulation Framework

### Simple Triangulation Process
**For each key insight, assess:**

**Source Agreement:**
- Multiple sources say the same thing = Strong evidence
- Sources say similar things with variations = Moderate evidence
- Sources contradict each other = Investigate the differences

**Source Credibility:**
- High credibility sources + agreement = Strong evidence
- Mix of credibility levels = Moderate evidence
- Limited credibility but best available = Working assumption

### Handling Contradictions
**When sources disagree:**
1. **Explore context** - Are both true in different situations?
2. **Check timing** - Has the situation changed over time?
3. **Consider populations** - Do different groups have different experiences?
4. **Weight by credibility** - Which source has more direct experience?
5. **Document the tension** - Sometimes the contradiction itself is the insight

## üìä Essential Evidence Application

### Theme Evidence Standards
**Use this simple framework:**

**STRONG EVIDENCE (E):**
- Multiple credible sources confirm the pattern
- Specific examples and details provided
- Consistent across different contexts

**MODERATE EVIDENCE (E*):**
- Several sources mention pattern with some variation
- Some specific examples but not comprehensive
- Generally consistent with acknowledged differences

**WORKING HYPOTHESIS (A):**
- Limited sources but pattern seems important
- Logical inference from available information
- Requires validation during implementation

### Evidence-Based Decision Making
**How to use evidence levels:**

**Strong Evidence Themes (E):**
- Primary focus for intervention design
- High confidence for proposals and funding
- Foundation for Theory of Change development

**Moderate Evidence Themes (E*):**
- Important considerations with built-in adaptation
- Areas for early validation during implementation

**Working Hypothesis Themes (A):**
- Areas for investigation rather than immediate intervention
- Pilot testing opportunities during startup

*Evidence assessment transforms stakeholder input from anecdotal information into credible intelligence for project design. Transparent acknowledgment of evidence strength builds credibility and provides foundation for adaptive implementation.*
