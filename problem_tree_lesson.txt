## üå≥ Understanding the Problem Tree Structure

### The Basic Framework
```
           üåø EFFECTS (Branches)
              What happens because 
              the problem exists?
                      ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
              üå≥ CORE PROBLEM (Trunk)
              The central issue your
              project will address
                      ‚¨ÜÔ∏è
           üå± ROOT CAUSES (Roots)
           Why does the problem exist?
           What enables or drives it?
```

### Key Components Explained

**üå≥ CORE PROBLEM (The Trunk)**
- The central issue your project aims to address
- Affects a specific population in a defined context
- Observable, measurable, and urgent
- Written WITHOUT causes or solutions included

*Example: "Young adults in rural communities have limited access to decent employment opportunities"*

**üå± ROOT CAUSES (The Roots)**
- Underlying reasons why the problem exists
- Go 2-3 levels deep by repeatedly asking "Why?"
- Consider multiple categories: economic, social, policy, geographic, cultural
- Each tagged as (E) Evidence-based or (A) Assumption needing validation

*Examples: Skills-market mismatch (E), Limited transportation (A), Weak entrepreneurship ecosystem (A)*

**üåø EFFECTS (The Branches)**
- Consequences that result because the problem persists
- Include immediate, medium-term, and long-term impacts
- Consider individual, community, and system-level impacts
- Show why solving this problem matters

*Examples: Income insecurity (E), Rural-urban migration (E), Lost economic potential (A)*

## ü§ñ AI-Enhanced Research: The MCP Method

### What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?
MCP is a structured way to instruct AI assistants like ChatGPT or Claude, ensuring you get focused, useful outputs instead of generic responses. Think of it as briefing a human research assistant‚Äîyou provide context, objectives, and clear instructions.

### Why Use AI for Problem Analysis?
- **Speed**: Accelerate initial literature review and source identification
- **Scope**: Quickly survey wide range of perspectives and evidence
- **Structure**: Get organized outputs that fit your analytical framework
- **Sources**: Identify credible reports and data you might have missed
- **Questions**: Generate stakeholder validation questions systematically

### The Four-Block MCP Structure

#### **Block 1: System Context (Define the AI's Role)**
```
You are an evidence-focused research assistant for nonprofits and social enterprises.
Behaviors: Be neutral, transparent, and concise. Always cite publisher + year for sources.
Prefer reputable sources (UN agencies, government statistics, peer-reviewed research, 
established NGOs). Clearly separate facts from assumptions. Flag uncertainties and 
potential bias in sources.
```

#### **Block 2: Knowledge Context (Share What You Know)**
```
Draft core problem: [Your 1-2 sentence problem statement]
Geographic/population scope: [Location, demographic details if relevant]
What we already know:
‚Ä¢ [Existing insight 1 with source if you have it]
‚Ä¢ [Existing insight 2]
‚Ä¢ [Existing insight 3]
Keywords and related terms: [List of relevant terms, synonyms, related concepts]
```

#### **Block 3: Task Context (Define Your Objectives)**
```
Research objectives:
1) Create a preliminary Problem Tree: core problem statement; 2-3 levels of root causes; 
   key effects/consequences
2) Suggest measurable indicators for each major cause and effect (indicator name ‚Ä¢ unit 
   of measurement ‚Ä¢ typical data sources)
3) Provide 5-10 credible sources for deeper reading (publisher ‚Ä¢ year ‚Ä¢ link if available)
4) Identify uncertainties, knowledge gaps, and assumptions that need stakeholder validation
5) Draft 10 targeted questions for stakeholder interviews/focus groups
```

#### **Block 4: Final Prompt (Clear Instruction)**
```
Using all the context provided above, generate:
- **Preliminary Problem Tree** in clear markdown format
- **Indicator suggestions** in table format
- **Recommended reading list** with full citations
- **List of uncertainties and assumptions** requiring validation
- **10 stakeholder validation questions** that are open-ended and non-leading
```

## üìä Quality Assurance for AI Outputs

### Essential Verification Steps

**Source Credibility Check:**
- [ ] **Are sources reputable?** (UN agencies, government stats, peer-reviewed, established NGOs)
- [ ] **Are they recent enough?** (Appropriate recency for your context)
- [ ] **Do links work and match descriptions?** (Spot-check 2-3 sources)

**Context Fit Assessment:**
- [ ] **Do findings match your geography/population?** (Not too general or mismatched)
- [ ] **Are cultural and economic contexts appropriate?** (Relevant to your setting)
- [ ] **Are there obvious contradictions?** (Note conflicting information)

**Evidence vs. Assumption Clarity:**
- [ ] **Are claims properly supported?** (Clear evidence vs. speculation)
- [ ] **Are limitations acknowledged?** (Gaps and uncertainties identified)
- [ ] **Is bias potential noted?** (Sources acknowledged limitations)

### Red Flags to Watch For
- ‚ùå **Generic responses** that could apply anywhere
- ‚ùå **Outdated sources** (check publication dates)
- ‚ùå **Broken or suspicious links** 
- ‚ùå **Claims without citations**
- ‚ùå **Overly confident assertions** without acknowledging uncertainty

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Implementation

### Phase 1: Research Planning (15-20 minutes)

**Step 1: Define Your Problem Scope**
- Write a clear 1-2 sentence problem statement
- Specify affected population and geographic area
- Note any time constraints or urgency factors
- List what you already know (even if limited)

**Step 2: Set Research Objectives**
- What do you need to understand about causes?
- What effects/consequences are you curious about?
- What would help you design better interventions?
- What stakeholders do you eventually need to engage?

**Step 3: Prepare Documentation System**
- Set up folder for sources and citations
- Create template for organizing findings
- Plan how you'll track evidence vs. assumptions

### Phase 2: AI-Assisted Research (30-40 minutes)

**Step 4: Customize Your MCP Prompt**
- Replace all {{placeholders}} with your specific context
- Review each block for relevance and clarity
- Prepare to copy-paste into AI platform

**Step 5: Execute and Review AI Research**
- Run complete MCP prompt in ChatGPT, Claude, or similar
- Save all outputs before proceeding
- Do initial scan for obvious errors or irrelevance

**Step 6: Quality Verification**
- Check credibility of 3-5 sources by opening links
- Verify key statistics against original sources
- Note any contradictions or gaps in coverage
- Flag items that seem like assumptions vs. evidence

### Phase 3: Problem Tree Construction (25-35 minutes)

**Step 7: Extract and Organize Core Problem**
- Refine problem statement based on research
- Ensure it specifies who, what, where
- Remove any causes or solutions that crept in
- Confirm it's observable and measurable

**Step 8: Map Root Causes by Levels**
- **Level 1 (Direct causes)**: What immediately creates the problem?
- **Level 2 (Underlying causes)**: Why do the direct causes exist?
- **Level 3 (Structural causes)**: What systems/conditions enable underlying causes?
- Tag each cause: (E) for evidence-based, (A) for assumption

**Step 9: Identify Effects by Time Horizon**
- **Immediate effects** (0-6 months): What happens right now?
- **Medium-term effects** (6 months-2 years): What develops over time?
- **Long-term effects** (2+ years): What are lasting consequences?
- Consider individual, community, and system-level impacts

### Phase 4: Stakeholder Preparation (15-20 minutes)

**Step 10: Convert Assumptions to Questions**
- Take every item marked (A) and turn it into an open-ended question
- Avoid leading questions that push toward your preferred answer
- Focus on understanding experience, not confirming theories
- Aim for 8-10 core questions that cover major assumptions

**Step 11: Plan Validation Approach**
- Identify which stakeholder types could answer your questions
- Consider how you'll reach and engage them meaningfully  
- Set realistic timeline for validation conversations
- Prepare to update your Problem Tree based on what you learn

## üìù Working Example: Youth Economic Participation

### Sample Problem Tree
```
## EFFECTS / CONSEQUENCES
‚Ä¢ High rates of youth income insecurity and household poverty (E)
‚Ä¢ Increased rural-urban migration of young adults (E)
‚Ä¢ Growing social tensions and petty crime in communities (A)
‚Ä¢ Lost economic potential and demographic dividend (A)

## CORE PROBLEM
"Young adults aged 18-25 in rural communities have limited access to decent, 
stable employment and livelihood opportunities"

## ROOT CAUSES
‚Ä¢ Skills-labor market mismatch (E)
  - Educational curricula not aligned with market needs (E)
  - Limited access to practical/vocational training (E)
  - Rapid economic transition outpacing skill development (A)
‚Ä¢ Geographic and infrastructure barriers (A)
  - Poor transportation connecting rural areas to job centers (E)
  - Limited internet connectivity for remote work (A)
  - Concentration of opportunities in urban centers (E)
‚Ä¢ Weak entrepreneurship and small business ecosystem (A)
  - Limited access to startup capital and microcredit (A)
  - Few successful business mentors or role models (A)
  - Complex regulatory and licensing requirements (E)
```

### Sample Stakeholder Validation Questions
1. **Problem validation**: "How would you describe the biggest economic challenges facing young people in this area?"
2. **Cause exploration**: "In your experience, what are the main reasons young people struggle to find good work here?"
3. **Skills assessment**: "What skills do local employers most need vs. what skills do young people typically have?"
4. **Access barriers**: "What makes it difficult for young people to start their own businesses or find employment?"
5. **Success examples**: "Can you tell me about young people who have found good opportunities? How did they do it?"

## ‚úÖ Quality Checklist

### Before Moving to Stakeholder Engagement

**Core Problem Quality:**
- [ ] Specific population and geographic scope defined
- [ ] Problem stated without embedded causes or solutions
- [ ] Observable, measurable, and clearly urgent
- [ ] Connects to your organization's mission and capacity

**Root Causes Analysis:**
- [ ] Causes answer "why" the problem exists (not just describe it)
- [ ] 2-3 levels of depth with sub-causes
- [ ] Mix of evidence-based (E) and assumption (A) items
- [ ] Cover multiple cause categories (economic, social, policy, etc.)
- [ ] Are potentially addressable through interventions

**Effects Mapping:**
- [ ] Realistic consequences across different time horizons
- [ ] Individual, community, and system-level impacts considered
- [ ] Clear connection between problem and effects
- [ ] Demonstrate why solving this problem matters

**Research Quality:**
- [ ] Major claims supported by credible, recent sources
- [ ] Evidence clearly separated from assumptions
- [ ] Knowledge gaps and uncertainties acknowledged  
- [ ] 8-10 stakeholder validation questions prepared
- [ ] Ready to learn from and be surprised by community insights

## üéØ Success Indicators

You're ready to move forward when:
- ‚úÖ **You can explain your Problem Tree** to a colleague in 2-3 minutes
- ‚úÖ **Your logic flows clearly** from causes through problem to effects
- ‚úÖ **You have good evidence** for key claims and clear assumptions to test
- ‚úÖ **You're genuinely curious** about what stakeholders will tell you
- ‚úÖ **You feel confident but not closed** to learning and revision

---

## üí° Tips for Success

### Making the Most of AI Research
- **Be specific in your MCP prompt** - vague inputs produce vague outputs
- **Always verify key claims** - AI can hallucinate sources or statistics
- **Use AI for acceleration, not authority** - it's a research assistant, not the final word
- **Tag everything clearly** - disciplined (E)/(A) marking prevents assumption creep

### Preparing for Stakeholder Validation
- **Stay curious, not confirmatory** - you're testing assumptions, not proving points
- **Plan to be surprised** - community insights often contradict desk research
- **Focus on learning** - the goal is better understanding, not validation of preconceptions
- **Build relationships** - these conversations are the start of ongoing partnerships
