#### Too Many Insights (80+)
**Solutions:**
- Work in batches (analyze by stakeholder group)
- Focus on most significant insights first
- Use sampling approach for very large datasets
- Consider multiple analysis sessions

#### Can't Identify Clear Themes
**Solutions:**
- Try different clustering approaches
- Step back and look for meta-patterns
- Involve team member for fresh perspective
- Consider that some themes may be weak - that's valid data

#### Team Disagreement on Clustering
**Solutions:**
- Document different perspectives rather than forcing consensus
- Use voting features for team input
- Try individual clustering first, then compare
- Focus on strongest patterns where agreement exists

## 📱 MOBILE CONSIDERATIONS

### Mobile Access Capabilities
| Tool | Mobile App | Mobile Browser | Touch Optimization |
|------|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Miro** | Yes (iOS/Android) | Limited functionality | Good |
| **Mural** | Yes (iOS/Android) | Limited functionality | Good |  
| **FigJam** | Yes (iOS/Android) | Good functionality | Excellent |

### Best Practices for Mobile Use
- **Use for review only** - main analysis should be desktop
- **Touch gestures** - pinch to zoom, two-finger pan
- **Voice notes** instead of typing for quick captures
- **Photo capture** of physical sticky note sessions for later digitization

## 💡 ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

### For Large Datasets (50+ stakeholders)
1. **Pre-clustering by stakeholder type** before main analysis
2. **Use tags and filters** to manage complexity
3. **Work in analysis sprints** (2-3 hour focused sessions)
4. **Create sub-boards** for detailed theme development

### For Cross-Cultural Analysis
1. **Preserve original language** insights when possible
2. **Use cultural context markers** in documentation
3. **Include cultural interpreters** in analysis process
4. **Note cultural patterns** as separate theme category

### For Ongoing Projects
1. **Create template boards** for repeated use
2. **Build insight libraries** that accumulate over time
3. **Version control** for evolving analysis
4. **Integration systems** with project management tools
