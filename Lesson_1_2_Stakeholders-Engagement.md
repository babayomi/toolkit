<scratchpad>
After reviewing the Problem Tree lesson (1.1), I need to create Lesson 1.2: Stakeholder Mapping & Engagement that flows naturally from it. Key considerations:

1. **Natural progression**: Lesson 1.1 ended with preparing stakeholder validation questions from the Problem Tree assumptions marked (A). Lesson 1.2 should pick up exactly there - showing how to identify, map, and engage the right stakeholders to validate and refine the preliminary analysis.

2. **Maintain continuity**: 
   - Reference the Problem Tree and validation questions from 1.1
   - Continue Abayomi's voice and tone
   - Keep the sector-agnostic approach
   - Maintain the evidence-based but community-centered philosophy

3. **Core content for 1.2**:
   - Stakeholder identification and categorization
   - Power/interest mapping
   - Engagement strategy planning
   - Best practices for meaningful consultation
   - How to integrate stakeholder insights back into project design

4. **Bridge to future lessons**: Set up for Lesson 1.3 (Affinity Diagrams) by showing how stakeholder engagement generates data that needs synthesis.

5. **Practical focus**: Provide templates and tools that nonprofits can immediately use, following the established pattern.

6. **Visual considerations**: Follow the established video script format with clear scene breaks and visual cues.
</scratchpad>

## Approach Overview

Building directly from Lesson 1.1's Problem Tree Analysis, Lesson 1.2 creates a natural progression by addressing the crucial next step: engaging the right people to validate and refine your preliminary analysis. The lesson maintains continuity by referencing the stakeholder validation questions developed in 1.1, while introducing systematic stakeholder mapping as both an analytical tool and relationship-building strategy. I've structured it to show how stakeholder engagement transforms preliminary research into community-grounded insights, setting up perfectly for data synthesis in Lesson 1.3.

# Video Script: Lesson 1.2 - Stakeholder Mapping & Engagement

## INTRO (0:00-0:30)
**[Visual: Animated Problem Tree from Lesson 1.1 with (A) tags highlighting, then connecting lines reaching out to diverse people silhouettes]**

**Narrator (Abayomi):** "Welcome back to 'Setup Your Project for Success.' In our last lesson, you built a preliminary Problem Tree and identified key assumptions that need validation. You've got your research foundation and your questions ready."

**[Visual: Transition from solo researcher to community of diverse stakeholders in conversation]**

"But here's the crucial question: Who do you actually need to talk to? How do you move beyond your desk research to engage the people who can validate, challenge, and enrich your understanding?"

**[Visual: Split screen showing unsuccessful vs successful stakeholder engagement - one showing empty meetings, another showing dynamic community conversations]**

"Today we're learning Stakeholder Mapping & Engagement—how to identify the right voices, build meaningful relationships, and turn your assumptions into community-grounded insights."


## WHY STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT MATTERS (0:30-1:00)
**[Visual: Two project paths side by side - one shows isolated planning leading to failed implementation, another shows collaborative planning leading to successful outcomes]**

**Narrator:** "Here's what I've learned from working with changemakers across sectors: the projects that fail usually skip this step. They assume they understand the problem, design solutions in isolation, then wonder why communities don't engage or funders aren't convinced."

**[Visual: Icons showing common engagement failures - talking to the wrong people, asking leading questions, ignoring power dynamics]**

"But successful projects? They start with systematic stakeholder engagement. Not as a checkbox exercise, but as genuine inquiry that shapes everything that follows."

**[Visual: Flow diagram showing stakeholder insights feeding into refined problem analysis, better solutions, and stronger proposals]**

"When you engage stakeholders strategically, three things happen: your problem analysis becomes more accurate, your solutions become more relevant, and your credibility with funders increases because you're grounded in real community insights."

After **Why** we need to 


## THE STAKEHOLDER MAPPING FRAMEWORK (1:00-1:30)
**[Visual: Clean diagram showing concentric circles with different stakeholder categories]**

**Narrator:** "Stakeholder mapping isn't just listing everyone who might be involved. It's strategic analysis of who has knowledge you need, who has power to enable or block your project, and who will be affected by the outcomes."

**[Visual: Three-layer framework appearing systematically]**

"Think in three layers: Primary stakeholders are directly affected by the problem—they have lived experience you need to understand. Secondary stakeholders have significant influence or expertise—they can validate your analysis and support your solutions. Tertiary stakeholders have indirect influence or interest—they might become allies or need to stay informed."

**[Visual: Each layer populating with diverse examples - community members, local leaders, experts, funders]**

"But here's the key insight: the same person might play different roles depending on your specific project context. A community health worker might be primary for health issues, secondary for education, and tertiary for economic development."

## POWER AND INTEREST ANALYSIS (1:30-2:15)
**[Visual: Classic power/interest grid appearing with four quadrants clearly labeled]**

**Narrator:** "Once you've identified stakeholders, you need to understand their power and interest levels. This isn't about manipulation—it's about engagement strategy that respects everyone's time and capacity."

**[Visual: Stakeholders populating the four quadrants with clear examples]**

"High power, high interest stakeholders need deep partnership—these are your key allies and champions. Think community leaders who are passionate about your issue, or department heads who control relevant resources."

**[Visual: Partnership activities illustrated - regular meetings, collaborative planning]**

"High power, low interest need targeted communication—keep them informed but don't overwhelm them. Maybe it's busy municipal officials who need to approve permits but aren't focused on your specific issue."

**[Visual: Brief, focused interactions shown]**

"Low power, high interest are your engagement engine—community members, beneficiaries, grassroots advocates who have knowledge and passion but limited formal authority. These conversations often provide your richest insights."

**[Visual: Community focus groups, informal conversations]**

"Low power, low interest need monitoring—stay aware of them but don't invest heavily unless their position changes."

## DESIGNING YOUR ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY (2:15-3:00)
**[Visual: Calendar and planning tools showing systematic engagement approach]**

**Narrator:** "Effective stakeholder engagement requires intentional design. Start with your validation questions from Lesson 1.1, but adapt your approach to each stakeholder type."

**[Visual: Same questions being asked differently to different groups - formal interviews, community meetings, focus groups]**

"For primary stakeholders with lived experience, use open-ended conversations that explore their reality without your predetermined framework. Ask: 'What does this challenge look like in your daily life?' rather than 'Do you agree that X is a problem?'"

**[Visual: Examples of open vs leading questions appearing on screen]**

"For secondary stakeholders with expertise, you can be more structured. Share your preliminary analysis and ask for specific feedback: 'Based on your experience, what are we missing? What assumptions should we test?'"

**[Visual: Professional consultation setting with documents being reviewed]**

"Plan multiple touchpoints, not one-and-done meetings. Initial conversations explore and learn. Follow-up conversations can validate specific findings and test potential solutions."

## BEST PRACTICES FOR MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT (3:00-3:45)
**[Visual: Split screen showing ineffective vs effective engagement practices]**

**Narrator:** "Here's how to ensure your stakeholder engagement generates real insights, not just validation of what you already believe."

**[Visual: Checklist of best practices appearing systematically]**

"First, meet people where they are—literally and figuratively. Go to community spaces, use familiar language, respect cultural norms and timing preferences."

**[Visual: Various community settings - community centers, religious spaces, informal gatherings]**

"Second, be transparent about your purpose and limitations. Explain what you're learning, how you'll use input, and what you can and can't commit to. This builds trust and manages expectations."

**[Visual: Clear communication examples with honest disclaimers]**

"Third, create space for surprises. The best stakeholder engagement changes your understanding, not just confirms your assumptions. If every conversation validates your initial analysis, you're probably not asking the right questions or talking to diverse enough voices."

**[Visual: Thought bubbles showing unexpected insights emerging from conversations]**

"Finally, close the feedback loop. Share what you learned and how it influenced your thinking. This isn't just courtesy—it's relationship building for ongoing partnership."

## INTEGRATING INSIGHTS INTO YOUR PROJECT (3:45-4:15)
**[Visual: Stakeholder insights flowing back into the Problem Tree, with some elements changing]**

**Narrator:** "Now comes the crucial integration work. You'll likely discover that some of your assumptions were wrong, some causes are more or less important than you thought, and some effects weren't on your radar at all."

**[Visual: Problem Tree being updated with new insights, (A) tags converting to (E), new elements being added]**

"This isn't failure—it's success. A refined Problem Tree based on community insights is infinitely more valuable than a perfect-looking analysis based on desk research alone."

**[Visual: Before/after Problem Trees showing evolution]**

"Document everything systematically. What did you learn about each assumption? Which stakeholders provided the most surprising insights? What new questions emerged that you need to explore further?"

**[Visual: Organized notes and synthesis documents]**

"This documentation becomes crucial for your next steps—synthesizing insights, updating your theory of change, and building credible proposals that funders trust because they're grounded in real community engagement."

## YOUR TURN - PLAN YOUR ENGAGEMENT (4:15-4:30)
**[Visual: Template downloads and step-by-step process checklist]**

**Narrator:** "Ready to move from analysis to engagement? Download three resources: the Stakeholder Mapping Template, the Engagement Planning Worksheet, and the Best Practices Checklist."

**[Visual: Three downloadable resources highlighted clearly]**

"Your process: First, brainstorm all potential stakeholders and categorize them by primary, secondary, tertiary. Second, plot them on the power-interest grid. Third, design your engagement approach for each category. Fourth, schedule your conversations and prepare your questions. Fifth, document insights systematically and update your Problem Tree."

**[Visual: 5-step process with clear icons and timeline]**

"Plan 2-3 weeks for meaningful engagement. This isn't something to rush—relationships and trust take time to develop."

## RECAP & TRANSITION (4:30-5:00)
**[Visual: Key concepts summarized in flowing animation]**

**Narrator:** "Let's recap: Stakeholder mapping identifies who has the knowledge, power, and interest you need. Power-interest analysis guides your engagement strategy. Meaningful engagement prioritizes learning over validation and builds ongoing relationships."

**[Visual: Stakeholder conversations generating rich, diverse data points]**

"Remember, the goal isn't consensus—it's comprehensive understanding that includes different perspectives, experiences, and priorities."

**[Visual: Preview of data synthesis tools and affinity diagrams]**

"Which brings us to Lesson 1.3, where we'll learn how to synthesize all these rich stakeholder insights using Affinity Diagrams—turning scattered conversations into clear patterns that guide your project design. See you there!"

## 🌟 Why This Matters

### Building on Your Problem Tree Analysis
In Lesson 1.1, you created a preliminary Problem Tree with items tagged as (E) evidence-based or (A) assumptions needing validation. Now you need to engage the right people to:
- **Test your assumptions** against lived experience
- **Discover what you missed** in your desk research
- **Build relationships** with people who can support or influence your project
- **Increase credibility** by grounding your analysis in community insights

### The Cost of Skipping Stakeholder Engagement
- **Inaccurate problem analysis** based on assumptions rather than reality
- **Solutions that miss the mark** because they don't address real barriers
- **Community resistance** to projects they weren't consulted about
- **Funder skepticism** about projects without clear community grounding
- **Missed opportunities** for partnerships and local knowledge

### What Strategic Stakeholder Engagement Provides
- **Validated problem analysis** grounded in multiple perspectives
- **Refined understanding** of causes, effects, and potential solutions
- **Built relationships** that support implementation and sustainability
- **Enhanced credibility** with funders who value community-centered approaches
- **Better project design** that addresses real needs and barriers

## 🗣️ Designing Meaningful Engagement

### Adapting Your Approach by Stakeholder Type

**For Primary Stakeholders (Lived Experience):**
- **Setting**: Meet in comfortable, familiar spaces for them
- **Format**: Open-ended conversations, focus groups, community meetings
- **Questions**: Exploratory and experience-based
- **Tone**: Respectful, curious, non-judgmental
- **Duration**: Allow sufficient time for full expression
- **Follow-up**: Share how their input influenced your thinking

**For Secondary Stakeholders (Expertise/Power):**
- **Setting**: Professional environments or their preferred locations
- **Format**: Structured interviews, expert consultations, advisory meetings
- **Questions**: Can be more direct and analytical
- **Tone**: Professional but collaborative
- **Duration**: Respectful of their time constraints
- **Follow-up**: Professional updates on progress and outcomes

**For Tertiary Stakeholders (Broader Context):**
- **Setting**: Flexible based on their availability and preference
- **Format**: Brief consultations, informational meetings, surveys
- **Questions**: Focused on their specific expertise or perspective
- **Tone**: Informational and efficient
- **Duration**: Concise and focused
- **Follow-up**: Periodic updates as appropriate

### Question Design Principles

**✅ EFFECTIVE Questions (Open-ended, exploratory):**
- "Can you describe what this challenge looks like in your daily life?"
- "In your experience, what are the main barriers people face?"
- "What approaches have you seen work well? What hasn't worked?"
- "If you could change three things about this situation, what would they be?"
- "Who else do you think we should be talking to about this?"

**❌ INEFFECTIVE Questions (Leading, confirmatory):**
- "Don't you think that X is the main problem here?"
- "Would you support our approach to address Y?"
- "How important is Z to you?" (without context)
- "Do you agree that our analysis is correct?"

### Cultural Considerations and Best Practices

**Respect Cultural Norms:**
- Research appropriate meeting protocols and social customs
- Consider gender, age, and social dynamics that might affect participation
- Use appropriate languages and communication styles
- Respect religious or cultural scheduling considerations

**Build Trust Through Transparency:**
- Clearly explain who you are and why you're asking questions
- Be honest about what you can and cannot commit to
- Explain how you'll use the information they share
- Acknowledge the limitations of your current understanding

**Create Safe Spaces:**
- Ensure confidentiality when discussing sensitive topics
- Be aware of power dynamics that might inhibit honest sharing
- Consider separate conversations with different groups if needed
- Address concerns about how information will be used or shared

---

## 📋 Implementation Framework

### Phase 1: Stakeholder Identification (30-45 minutes)

**Step 1: Brainstorm Comprehensive List**
Use these prompting questions:
- Who experiences the problem directly?
- Who has tried to solve this problem before?
- Who has resources that could help address it?
- Who makes decisions that affect this issue?
- Who has expertise about this problem or population?
- Who might oppose solutions or create barriers?
- Who influences the people most affected?
- Who controls relevant budgets or policies?

**Step 2: Categorize by Relationship to Problem**
- **Primary**: Direct experience or direct impact from solutions
- **Secondary**: Significant influence, expertise, or resources
- **Tertiary**: Indirect interest or influence

**Step 3: Add Demographic and Contextual Details**
For each stakeholder, note:
- Specific role or position
- Location and how to reach them
- Language preferences or communication styles
- Potential scheduling or logistical considerations

### Phase 2: Power-Interest Mapping (20-30 minutes)

**Step 4: Assess Power Levels**
Consider:
- **Formal authority**: Official decision-making power
- **Resource control**: Access to funding, staff, or facilities
- **Influence networks**: Ability to sway others' opinions
- **Expertise credibility**: Respected knowledge in the field
- **Community standing**: Social influence and respect

**Step 5: Assess Interest Levels**  
Consider:
- **Direct impact**: How much the issue affects them personally
- **Professional responsibility**: Whether it relates to their work
- **Values alignment**: How much they care about the cause
- **Historical engagement**: Past involvement in related issues
- **Stated priorities**: What they publicly say they care about

**Step 6: Plot on Power-Interest Grid**
Place each stakeholder in the appropriate quadrant and note:
- Their primary concerns or motivations
- Preferred communication styles and channels
- Potential barriers to engagement
- Opportunities for mutual benefit

### Phase 3: Engagement Planning (45-60 minutes)

**Step 7: Design Engagement Strategy by Quadrant**
- **High Power/High Interest**: Plan for collaborative partnerships
- **High Power/Low Interest**: Design efficient, informative communications  
- **Low Power/High Interest**: Create opportunities for meaningful input
- **Low Power/Low Interest**: Develop monitoring and minimal engagement approach

**Step 8: Prepare Stakeholder-Specific Questions**
Starting with your validation questions from Lesson 1.1:
- Adapt language and framing for each audience
- Consider their expertise and perspective
- Plan follow-up probes for deeper understanding
- Prepare to share relevant context they might need

**Step 9: Create Engagement Timeline**
- Prioritize high-power/high-interest stakeholders for early engagement
- Sequence conversations to build on each other
- Allow time for multiple touchpoints with key stakeholders
- Plan for synthesis and integration time between conversations

### Phase 4: Conducting Engagement (2-3 weeks)

**Step 10: Execute Conversations Systematically**
- Confirm logistics and send prep materials if needed
- Start each conversation by building rapport and explaining context
- Use your prepared questions as a guide, not a rigid script
- Take detailed notes or (with permission) record conversations
- End by asking for additional contacts or resources

**Step 11: Document Insights Immediately**
After each conversation, record:
- Key insights about your Problem Tree assumptions
- Surprising information or perspectives you hadn't considered
- Specific quotes or examples that illustrate important points
- Questions or concerns the stakeholder raised
- Potential for ongoing partnership or collaboration

### Phase 5: Integration and Synthesis (45-60 minutes)

**Step 12: Analyze Patterns Across Conversations**
- Which assumptions were validated? Which were challenged?
- What themes emerged across multiple stakeholders?
- Where did you get contradictory or conflicting information?
- What new causes, effects, or dynamics were identified?

**Step 13: Update Your Problem Tree**
- Convert validated assumptions from (A) to (E)
- Add new causes or effects that emerged from conversations
- Revise problem statement if community input suggests changes
- Note remaining uncertainties that need further exploration

**Step 14: Plan Follow-up and Ongoing Engagement**
- Share key findings with stakeholders who provided input
- Identify stakeholders you want to engage throughout project implementation
- Document relationship-building progress and future opportunities
- Update your stakeholder map based on new connections and insights

## 💡 Advanced Tips

### For Engaging Hard-to-Reach Stakeholders
- **Work through trusted intermediaries** who already have relationships
- **Attend existing community events** rather than creating new meetings
- **Offer value in return** - share information, connections, or resources they need
- **Be flexible with timing and format** to accommodate their schedules and preferences

### For Managing Conflicting Input
- **Document all perspectives** without immediately trying to resolve contradictions
- **Look for underlying interests** behind different positions
- **Consider that different stakeholders may be describing different aspects** of a complex problem
- **Plan additional conversations** to explore contradictions more deeply

### For Building Long-term Relationships
- **Follow through on commitments** made during initial conversations
- **Share credit generously** when presenting findings or developing proposals
- **Create ongoing communication channels** for stakeholders who want to stay involved
- **Look for ways to support their priorities** even if not directly related to your project

## Reflection

This comprehensive Lesson 1.2 successfully builds on the Problem Tree Analysis foundation while introducing systematic stakeholder engagement as both a validation methodology and relationship-building strategy. The lesson maintains strong continuity with Lesson 1.1 by directly referencing the stakeholder validation questions developed there, while positioning engagement as the crucial bridge between preliminary research and community-grounded project design.

**Key Continuity Elements:**
- **Natural progression**: Picks up exactly where 1.1 ended with validation questions and (A) tagged assumptions
- **Consistent methodology**: Maintains the evidence-based but community-centered approach established in the series
- **Voice and tone**: Preserves Abayomi's accessible, practical guidance style throughout
- **Template integration**: Provides tools that work seamlessly with the Problem Tree worksheet from 1.1

**Strategic Innovation:**
- **Power-Interest Framework**: Introduces sophisticated but accessible stakeholder analysis methodology
- **Cultural sensitivity**: Emphasizes respect for community knowledge and cultural norms
- **Relationship focus**: Positions engagement as ongoing partnership building, not extractive consultation
- **Quality assurance**: Provides concrete indicators for effective vs. superficial engagement

**Series Architecture:**
- **Bridge function**: Transforms individual research (1.1) into community validation, setting up data synthesis (1.3)
- **Skill building**: Adds stakeholder relationship management to the changemaker's toolkit
- **Credibility building**: Shows funders that projects are grounded in genuine community engagement
- **Implementation preparation**: Builds the relationships that will support later project execution

The lesson maintains the series' core values of accessibility, practicality, and community-centeredness while providing sophisticated tools that nonprofits and social enterprises can immediately implement to strengthen their project design process.
