# üîç Assumption Identification & Testing

Framework for identifying critical assumptions and designing validation approaches that strengthen theory credibility and implementation success through systematic hypothesis testing and adaptive learning.

---

## üéØ Understanding Assumptions in Theory of Change

Assumptions are the testable hypotheses underlying your Theory of Change logic - explicit statements about conditions, behaviors, and processes that must hold true for your change pathway to work as expected.

### Why Assumption Testing Matters

**For Theory Credibility:**
- Makes implicit beliefs explicit and testable
- Demonstrates analytical rigor and self-awareness
- Builds funder confidence through honest uncertainty acknowledgment
- Provides framework for learning and adaptation

**For Implementation Success:**
- Identifies highest-risk elements requiring early validation
- Guides where to focus monitoring and evaluation resources
- Creates early warning system for pathway adjustments needed
- Enables proactive rather than reactive program management

**For Community Partnership:**
- Tests external assumptions against community knowledge and experience
- Creates opportunities for community input on theory logic
- Builds shared understanding of change expectations
- Strengthens community ownership through collaborative learning

## üìã Systematic Assumption Identification

### Assumption Mining Process

**Step 1: Logic Chain Analysis (20-30 minutes)**
```
ASSUMPTION EXTRACTION FROM PATHWAYS:

For each IF-THEN-BECAUSE statement in your Theory of Change:

PATHWAY: IF [intervention] THEN [outcome] BECAUSE [change mechanism]

Hidden Assumptions Check:
‚ñ° What must be true about target population for intervention to work?
‚ñ° What must be true about implementation context?
‚ñ° What must be true about other actors and systems?
‚ñ° What must be true about timing and sequencing?
‚ñ° What must be true about resources and capacity?

Example Analysis:
Pathway: "IF we provide skills training THEN youth will get jobs BECAUSE employers value these skills"

Hidden Assumptions:
- Youth will attend training regularly (stakeholder behavior)
- Training content will remain relevant (market dynamics)
- Employers will hire locally rather than recruit externally (system behavior)
- Economic conditions will support job creation (external context)
- Youth will remain in community after training (stakeholder behavior)
```

**Step 2: Stakeholder Response Assumptions**
```
STAKEHOLDER BEHAVIOR ASSUMPTION IDENTIFICATION:

TARGET POPULATION ASSUMPTIONS:
For each key stakeholder group, identify assumptions about their response:

Stakeholder Group: [Primary beneficiaries]
Assumption 1: [What you expect about their participation]
- Basis: [Why you believe this - stakeholder input, research, experience]
- Risk: [What happens if this assumption is wrong]

Assumption 2: [What you expect about their behavior change]
- Basis: [Why you believe this]
- Risk: [What happens if this assumption is wrong]

Stakeholder Group: [Community leaders]
Assumption 1: [What you expect about their support/involvement]
- Basis: [Why you believe this]
- Risk: [What happens if this assumption is wrong]

Stakeholder Group: [Institutional actors]  
Assumption 1: [What you expect about their cooperation]
- Basis: [Why you believe this]
- Risk: [What happens if this assumption is wrong]

ASSUMPTION VALIDATION QUESTIONS:
‚ñ° Have we actually asked stakeholders about these expectations?
‚ñ° Do stakeholders confirm these assumptions match their experience?
‚ñ° What do stakeholders say could prevent these assumptions from holding?
‚ñ° How do power dynamics affect stakeholder ability to respond as expected?
```

**Step 3: System Dynamics Assumptions**
```

INSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM ASSUMPTIONS:
Assumption: [What you expect about how institutions will respond to change efforts]
Evidence Base: [Institution analysis or experience supporting this]
Risk Assessment: [High/Medium/Low - impact if assumption fails]

Example:
Assumption: "Government health officials will support community health worker integration if evidence shows positive results"
Evidence Base: "Health officials expressed interest in evidence-based solutions during stakeholder interviews"
Risk Assessment: Medium - could affect scaling and sustainability

MARKET/ECONOMIC SYSTEM ASSUMPTIONS:
Assumption: [What you expect about economic conditions or market responses]
Evidence Base: [Market analysis supporting this expectation]
Risk Assessment: [High/Medium/Low]

POLITICAL SYSTEM ASSUMPTIONS:
Assumption: [What you expect about political stability or support]
Evidence Base: [Political analysis supporting this expectation]
Risk Assessment: [High/Medium/Low]

SOCIAL SYSTEM ASSUMPTIONS:
Assumption: [What you expect about social norms or cultural responses]
Evidence Base: [Cultural analysis supporting this expectation]
Risk Assessment: [High/Medium/Low]
```

**Step 4: Implementation Context Assumptions**
```
CONTEXT ASSUMPTION IDENTIFICATION:

RESOURCE AVAILABILITY ASSUMPTIONS:
Assumption: [What you expect about continued resource access]
Evidence Base: [Funding commitments or resource analysis supporting this]
Risk Assessment: [High/Medium/Low]

ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY ASSUMPTIONS:
Assumption: [What you expect about your organization's ability to implement]
Evidence Base: [Capacity assessment supporting this expectation]
Risk Assessment: [High/Medium/Low]

PARTNERSHIP ASSUMPTIONS:
Assumption: [What you expect about partner collaboration and reliability]
Evidence Base: [Partnership discussions supporting this expectation]  
Risk Assessment: [High/Medium/Low]

EXTERNAL FACTOR ASSUMPTIONS:
Assumption: [What you expect about external conditions remaining stable]
Evidence Base: [Environmental analysis supporting this expectation]
Risk Assessment: [High/Medium/Low]

TIMING ASSUMPTIONS:
Assumption: [What you expect about timeframes for change processes]
Evidence Base: [Research or experience supporting these timeframes]
Risk Assessment: [High/Medium/Low]
```

- "What concerns would parents have about children spending time in training?"
- "How have previous training programs worked in this community?"
- "What would need to be true for parents to encourage participation?"

Validation Results Analysis:
Strong Support: [Stakeholder input strongly supporting assumption]
Qualified Support: [Support with conditions or concerns noted]
Contradictory Input: [Stakeholder input challenging assumption]
Context Factors: [Local factors that affect assumption validity]

Assumption Refinement:
