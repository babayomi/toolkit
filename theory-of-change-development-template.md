## üéØ Theory of Change Development Worksheet

### Phase 1: Foundation Assessment (30 minutes)

**Problem Integration Review:**
```
PROBLEM TREE INTEGRATION SUMMARY:
Core Problem Statement: [From integrated Problem Tree]
Key Root Causes Identified: [List 3-5 most critical causes]
Primary Effects/Consequences: [List 3-5 most significant effects]
Evidence Strength: [Note which elements have strong vs. moderate evidence]

STAKEHOLDER PRIORITY SYNTHESIS:
Most Emphasized Issues: [What stakeholders most frequently mentioned]
Community-Defined Success: [How stakeholders describe desired change]
Existing Assets/Strengths: [Resources and capabilities communities identified]
Change Agent Opportunities: [Who stakeholders see as potential partners]

AFFINITY THEMES CONNECTION:
Priority Theme 1: [Name] - Intervention Opportunity: [What this suggests]
Priority Theme 2: [Name] - Intervention Opportunity: [What this suggests]
Priority Theme 3: [Name] - Intervention Opportunity: [What this suggests]
```

### Phase 2: Vision Development (20-25 minutes)

**Long-term Vision (Impact) Design:**
```
VISION DEVELOPMENT TEMPLATE:

10-Year Aspiration:
"In 10 years, [target population] will experience [specific systemic change] 
as evidenced by [observable outcomes] because [root causes addressed]."

Example:
"In 10 years, rural youth will have equal access to quality employment opportunities 
as evidenced by 80% youth employment rate matching urban areas because skills training 
is market-responsive and local economic development creates diverse job opportunities."

Community Language Version:
[Rewrite vision using terminology and framing stakeholders would recognize]

Vision Components Check:
‚ñ° Addresses root causes identified in Problem Tree
‚ñ° Reflects stakeholder priorities and definitions of success
‚ñ° Measurable through observable indicators
‚ñ° Inspiring and motivating for long-term effort
‚ñ° Realistic given systemic change timeframes
```

**Vision Testing Questions:**
- Would community stakeholders recognize this vision as reflecting their priorities?
- Does this vision address root causes or just symptoms?
- Can progress toward this vision be observed and measured?
- Does this vision inspire sustained effort over multiple years?

### Phase 3: Outcome Chain Development (40-50 minutes)

**Backward Design Process:**
```
OUTCOME CHAIN TEMPLATE:

IMPACT (5-10 years):
[Long-term vision statement from Phase 2]

LONG-TERM OUTCOMES (3-5 years):
What systemic/structural changes must occur for impact to be achieved?
Outcome 1: [Structural change needed]
- Indicators: [How you'll know this is happening]
- Evidence requirement: [Strong/Moderate/Working hypothesis]

Outcome 2: [Environmental change needed]
- Indicators: [How you'll know this is happening]
- Evidence requirement: [Strong/Moderate/Working hypothesis]

MEDIUM-TERM OUTCOMES (18 months-3 years):
What behavioral/practice changes must occur for long-term outcomes?
Outcome 1: [Individual behavior changes]
- Indicators: [How you'll know this is happening]
- Stakeholder validation: [Community confirmation this is realistic]

Outcome 2: [Organizational practice changes]
- Indicators: [How you'll know this is happening]
- Stakeholder validation: [Community confirmation this is realistic]

Outcome 3: [System/policy changes]
- Indicators: [How you'll know this is happening]
- Stakeholder validation: [Community confirmation this is realistic]

SHORT-TERM OUTCOMES (6-18 months):
What capacity changes must occur for behavioral changes?
Outcome 1: [Individual capacity - knowledge, skills, attitudes]
- Indicators: [How you'll know this is happening]
- Intervention connection: [What activities will produce this]

Outcome 2: [Community capacity - resources, networks, leadership]
- Indicators: [How you'll know this is happening]
- Intervention connection: [What activities will produce this]

Outcome 3: [Institutional capacity - policies, procedures, systems]
- Indicators: [How you'll know this is happening]
- Intervention connection: [What activities will produce this]
```

### Phase 4: Change Pathway Logic (35-45 minutes)

**If-Then Pathway Development:**
```
CHANGE PATHWAY TEMPLATE:

For each outcome level, create if-then statements:

SHORT-TERM PATHWAYS:
IF [specific activity] THEN [short-term outcome] BECAUSE [assumption about how change occurs]

Example:
IF we provide market-responsive skills training THEN participants will gain job-ready capabilities 
BECAUSE training curriculum matches employer requirements and includes practical experience.

Pathway 1: IF [activity] THEN [short-term outcome] BECAUSE [assumption]
Pathway 2: IF [activity] THEN [short-term outcome] BECAUSE [assumption]
Pathway 3: IF [activity] THEN [short-term outcome] BECAUSE [assumption]

MEDIUM-TERM PATHWAYS:
IF [short-term outcomes achieved] THEN [medium-term outcome] BECAUSE [assumption about behavior change]

Example:
IF participants gain job-ready capabilities AND employers engage in training design 
THEN youth employment rates will increase BECAUSE skills match market needs and employer trust builds.

Pathway 1: IF [short-term outcomes] THEN [medium-term outcome] BECAUSE [assumption]
Pathway 2: IF [short-term outcomes] THEN [medium-term outcome] BECAUSE [assumption]

LONG-TERM PATHWAYS:
IF [medium-term outcomes achieved] THEN [long-term outcome] BECAUSE [assumption about systemic change]

Example:
IF youth employment increases AND local economic development creates diverse opportunities 
THEN rural youth will have equal access to employment BECAUSE economic opportunities diversify and skills infrastructure strengthens.

Pathway 1: IF [medium-term outcomes] THEN [long-term outcome] BECAUSE [assumption]
Pathway 2: IF [medium-term outcomes] THEN [long-term outcome] BECAUSE [assumption]
```

### Phase 5: Assumption Identification & Risk Assessment (25-30 minutes)

**Critical Assumption Analysis:**
```
ASSUMPTION IDENTIFICATION TEMPLATE:

STAKEHOLDER BEHAVIOR ASSUMPTIONS:

## üîß Adaptation Guidelines for Different Contexts

### Rural vs Urban Contexts

**Rural Context Adaptations:**
- **Longer timelines** for behavior change due to traditional practice strength
- **Geographic barriers** require mobile/distributed service delivery models
- **Traditional authority** structures must be engaged in change process
- **Resource constraints** require low-cost, locally sustainable approaches

**Urban Context Adaptations:**
- **Faster pace** of change but higher competition for attention
- **Diverse populations** require culturally responsive approaches
- **Formal systems** may be more accessible but also more bureaucratic
- **Resource availability** may be higher but also more expensive

### Different Organization Sizes

**Small Organization (Budget <$50K/year):**
- **Focused scope** - fewer outcomes with deeper community engagement
- **Partnership reliance** - leverage other organizations' resources
- **Volunteer dependence** - assumptions about sustained volunteer commitment
- **Local change focus** - community-level rather than systems-level outcomes

**Medium Organization (Budget $50K-$500K/year):**
- **Multi-level approach** - individual, community, and some system change
- **Professional staff** - assumptions about staff capacity and retention
- **Multiple partnerships** - coordination complexity considerations
- **Regional influence** - outcomes spanning multiple communities

**Large Organization (Budget >$500K/year):**
- **Systems change focus** - policy and institutional transformation capacity
- **Research integration** - evidence generation as part of theory
- **Multi-year commitments** - longer-term outcome achievement realistic
- **National/international** - scaling and replication considerations

### Cultural Context Considerations

**Collective Culture Adaptations:**
- **Community consensus** processes for decision-making
- **Group outcomes** prioritized over individual achievements
- **Extended timeframes** for relationship building and trust development
- **Traditional knowledge** integration into intervention design

**Individualistic Culture Adaptations:**
- **Personal benefit** emphasis in outcome framing
- **Individual choice** and autonomy respected in change pathways
- **Faster implementation** timelines but potentially less community ownership
- **Measurable individual** indicators prioritized
