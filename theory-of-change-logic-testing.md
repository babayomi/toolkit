# ‚úÖ Logic Testing & Quality Assurance

Systematic methods for testing change pathway logic and overall coherence to ensure theories are sound, credible, and actionable while maintaining community grounding and evidence-based foundations.

---

## üéØ Theory of Change Logic Framework

Quality Theory of Change demonstrates clear, logical progression from interventions to impact, with each component building coherently on previous levels while maintaining evidence-based credibility throughout.

### Logic Architecture Components

**Vertical Logic (Causal Flow):**
- **Activities ‚Üí Outputs:** Direct products of intervention implementation
- **Outputs ‚Üí Short-term Outcomes:** Immediate changes resulting from outputs
- **Short-term ‚Üí Medium-term Outcomes:** Behavioral/practice changes building on capacity
- **Medium-term ‚Üí Long-term Outcomes:** System changes building on behavior changes
- **Long-term Outcomes ‚Üí Impact:** Ultimate transformation when systems change

**Horizontal Logic (Supporting Elements):**
- **Assumptions:** Testable hypotheses underlying each causal link
- **External Factors:** Conditions outside project control affecting logic
- **Indicators:** Observable measures for tracking progress at each level
- **Timeline:** Realistic timeframes for each change level

### Logic Quality Criteria

**Causal Plausibility:** Each level logically leads to the next with clear mechanisms
**Evidence Base:** Logic grounded in Problem Tree analysis and stakeholder insights  
**Realistic Scope:** Ambitions match organizational capacity and resources
**Cultural Appropriateness:** Change expectations align with community context
**Assumption Explicitness:** Critical hypotheses stated clearly and testably

## üìã Systematic Logic Testing Process

### Test 1: Causal Chain Analysis

**Step-by-Step Logic Verification:**
```
CAUSAL CHAIN TESTING TEMPLATE:

ACTIVITY TO OUTPUT TEST:
Activity: [Specific intervention activity]
Expected Output: [Direct product of activity]
Logic Test Questions:
‚ñ° Will this activity directly produce this output?
‚ñ° What conditions must exist for this output to occur?
‚ñ° How will we know this output has been achieved?
‚ñ° What could prevent this activity from producing expected output?

Evidence Support: [Problem Tree/stakeholder insights supporting this connection]
Risk Factors: [What could disrupt this causal link]
Assumption: [Key hypothesis underlying this connection]

OUTPUT TO SHORT-TERM OUTCOME TEST:
Output: [Direct product from activity]
Expected Short-term Outcome: [Immediate change expected]
Logic Test Questions:
‚ñ° Will this output lead to this short-term outcome?
‚ñ° What change mechanism connects output to outcome?
‚ñ° How realistic is this timeframe for this type of change?
‚ñ° What stakeholder response is required for this connection?

Evidence Support: [Community validation of this change sequence]
Change Mechanism: [How output creates outcome - knowledge, skill, attitude, network]
Timeline Reality: [Whether timeframe realistic for change type]

SHORT-TERM TO MEDIUM-TERM OUTCOME TEST:
Short-term Outcome: [Capacity/awareness change]
Expected Medium-term Outcome: [Behavior/practice change]
Logic Test Questions:
‚ñ° Will capacity/awareness changes lead to behavior changes?
‚ñ° What motivations/incentives support behavior change?
‚ñ° What barriers could prevent behavior adoption?
‚ñ° How does cultural context affect behavior change likelihood?

Behavior Change Logic: [Why people will change practices based on capacity changes]
Cultural Factors: [How community values support/hinder behavior change]
Motivation Analysis: [What drives stakeholders to adopt new behaviors]

MEDIUM-TERM TO LONG-TERM OUTCOME TEST:

Expected Long-term Outcome: [System/structural changes]
Logic Test Questions:
‚ñ° Will individual/community changes create system changes?

Logic Test Questions:
‚ñ° Will system changes create lasting transformation?
‚ñ° How do different system changes work together for impact?
‚ñ° What sustains impact beyond project period?
‚ñ° How does impact address root causes from Problem Tree?

SO WHAT? How does this change lead to further change?

Medium-term Outcome: [Behavioral change]  
SO WHAT? How does this behavior change create broader change?

Long-term Outcome: [System change]
SO WHAT? How does this system change create lasting impact?

Impact: [Ultimate transformation]
SO WHAT? How does this transformation address core problem?

LOGIC STRENGTH ASSESSMENT:
