## üéØ Master Problem Tree Analysis

This comprehensive toolkit helps you **clarify the root causes, core problem, and consequences** of a key challenge in your project design. Whether you're tackling health issues, education gaps, environmental challenges, or economic development, problem tree analysis provides the foundation for everything from activities to budgets to impact measurement.

### üåü Why Problem Tree Analysis Matters

**The Problem with Most Social Impact Projects:**
- Vague problem definition ‚Üí Unfocused solutions
- Assumption-based planning ‚Üí Solutions that miss the mark  
- Weak evidence base ‚Üí Unconvincing proposals
- Skip community validation ‚Üí Projects that don't resonate

**What Problem Tree Analysis Provides:**
- **Clarity** on what problem you're really solving
- **Logic** that connects causes to problems to effects
- **Evidence base** that supports your intervention choices
- **Stakeholder questions** that guide meaningful community engagement
