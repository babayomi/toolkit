- Supports stakeholder discussions and validation processes
- Creates shared reference point for implementation teams

**For Planning:**
- Reveals logical connections and dependencies between components
- Identifies missing elements or weak links in change pathways
- Supports resource allocation and timeline planning
- Guides measurement and evaluation framework development

**For Monitoring:**
- Provides clear framework for tracking progress across outcome levels
- Enables visual progress reporting for diverse audiences
- Supports adaptive management through visual pathway assessment
- Facilitates learning capture and theory refinement

### Audience-Appropriate Visualization

**Community Audiences:** Simple, story-based visuals with cultural relevance
**Funder Audiences:** Professional diagrams emphasizing logic and evidence
