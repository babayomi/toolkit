# üìã Engagement Planning Worksheet

Phase-by-phase framework for designing targeted engagement approaches for different stakeholder groups. Transform your stakeholder analysis into actionable engagement plans that build relationships while gathering essential insights.

---

## üîó Building on Your Foundation

### From Analysis to Action
You've identified stakeholders with the [Identification Template](../stakeholder-identification-template/) and prioritized them using the [Power-Interest Grid](../stakeholder-power-interest-grid/). Now it's time to create specific engagement plans that will help validate your [Problem Tree assumptions](../../problem-tree-analysis/).

### Strategic Sequencing
The order of engagement matters. Start with high-power/high-interest stakeholders who can open doors, provide critical validation, and help you refine your approach before broader engagement.

- [ ] Overview of how input will be used
- [ ] Consent forms if needed
- [ ] Contact information and follow-up process

[1-2 sentences: The problem you're addressing and why]

[1-2 sentences: Why their input is valuable]

[1 sentence: Specific ask - meeting, interview, review]

[1 sentence: Time commitment and flexibility]

[Closing with next steps]
```

**SMS/WhatsApp for Community Members:**
```
Hello [Name], I'm [Your name] from [Organization]. 
We're working on [issue] in [location]. 
Your experience with [specific aspect] would really help us understand better. 
Could we talk for 30 minutes this week? 
I can come to you. When works best?
```

### Step 2.2: Outreach Tracking System

| Stakeholder | Contact Method | Date Contacted | Response | Meeting Scheduled | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | Email/Phone/In-person | | Yes/No/Pending | Date/Time | |
| | | | | | |

### Step 2.3: Scheduling Considerations

**Timing Factors:**
- Work schedules (evenings/weekends for working people)
- Cultural/religious calendars (avoid holidays, prayer times)
- Agricultural seasons (planting/harvest times)
- Weather patterns (rainy season accessibility)
- School schedules (for parent engagement)

**Location Factors:**
- Stakeholder comfort (their space vs. neutral venue)
- Accessibility (transportation, disability access)
- Privacy needs (sensitive topics)

## üí¨ Phase 3: Active Engagement (Week 5-8)

### Step 3.1: Engagement Method Selection

| Method | Best For | Duration | Pros | Cons |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **One-on-One Interview** | Key informants, sensitive topics | 45-90 min | Deep insights, builds trust | Time intensive, limited reach |
| **Focus Group** | Community perspectives, group dynamics | 90-120 min | Efficient, generates discussion | Dominant voices, groupthink |
| **Community Meeting** | Broad input, public validation | 2-3 hours | Inclusive, transparent | Logistics complex, superficial |
| **Survey** | Quantitative data, wide reach | 15-30 min | Scalable, anonymous option | Limited depth, literacy barriers |
| **Observation** | Understanding context, behavior | Variable | Real-world insights | Time intensive, interpretation bias |
| **Workshop** | Co-creation, capacity building | Half/full day | Participatory, empowering | Resource intensive, scheduling |

### Step 3.2: Conversation Guide Framework

**Opening (5 minutes):**
- Thank them for their time
- Introduce yourself and organization

- Invite questions about the process

**Core Questions (30-40 minutes):**
- Start broad: "Tell me about your experience with [issue]"
- Probe deeper: "Can you give me an example?"
- Validate assumptions: "We've heard that [assumption]. Does that match your experience?"
- Explore solutions: "What would need to change?"
- Identify others: "Who else should we talk to?"

**Closing (5-10 minutes):**
- Summarize key points you heard
- Ask if anything was missed
- Explain next steps and timeline
- Confirm follow-up preferences
- Express gratitude

### Step 3.3: Engagement Preparation Checklist

**24 Hours Before:**
