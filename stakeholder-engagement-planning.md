# üìã Engagement Planning Worksheet

Phase-by-phase framework for designing targeted engagement approaches for different stakeholder groups. Transform your stakeholder analysis into actionable engagement plans that build relationships while gathering essential insights.

---

## üîó Building on Your Foundation

### From Analysis to Action
You've identified stakeholders with the [Identification Template](../stakeholder-identification-template/) and prioritized them using the [Power-Interest Grid](../stakeholder-power-interest-grid/). Now it's time to create specific engagement plans that will help validate your [Problem Tree assumptions](../../problem-tree-analysis/).

### Strategic Sequencing
The order of engagement matters. Start with high-power/high-interest stakeholders who can open doors, provide critical validation, and help you refine your approach before broader engagement.

### Step 1.1: Define Engagement Objectives

For each stakeholder group, clarify:

- [ ] Clear explanation of why you're engaging stakeholders
- [ ] Overview of how input will be used
- [ ] Consent forms if needed
- [ ] Contact information and follow-up process

**Adapt for Different Audiences:**
- **Community members**: Simple language, visual aids, local examples
- **Officials**: Formal brief, data focus, policy alignment
- **Technical experts**: Detailed methodology, evidence base, research questions
- **Funders**: Impact potential, sustainability plan, budget overview

### Step 1.3: Assign Team Roles

| Role | Responsibilities | Person Assigned |
|---|---|---|
| Engagement Lead | Overall coordination, key relationships | |
| Logistics Coordinator | Scheduling, venues, materials | |
