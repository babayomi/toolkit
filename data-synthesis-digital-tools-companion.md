## üìù Physical Method: Complete Setup Guide

### Materials Checklist
```
Essential Materials:
‚ñ° 3-4 packs of different colored sticky notes (3x3 inches)
‚ñ° 2-3 thick black markers (Sharpies work well)
‚ñ° Large wall space or multiple flip chart pages
‚ñ° Masking tape (if wall won't hold sticky notes)
‚ñ° Timer for process management
‚ñ° Mobile phone/camera for documentation

Color Coding System:
- Yellow: Direct stakeholder quotes
- Pink: Observation/interpretation insights  
- Blue: Research/expert insights
- Green: Questions or contradictions
```

### Space Setup Instructions
```
Wall Preparation:
1. Clear wall space 6-8 feet wide, 4-5 feet high
2. Test that sticky notes adhere well
3. Ensure good lighting and comfortable standing access
4. Have table nearby for materials and source documents
5. Consider sight lines if multiple people participating

Layout Planning:
- Left side: Capture area for initial insights
- Center: Clustering workspace  
- Right side: Final theme organization
- Bottom: Parking area for outliers/questions
```

### Physical Process Workflow

**Phase 1: CAPTURE**
```
1. Set up "insight factory" system:
   - One person reads source document aloud
   - Others write insights on sticky notes
   - Use one insight per note, legible writing
   - Call out source for attribution

2. Organize by source type:
   - Group by interview, focus group, research source
   - Use different colors for different stakeholder types
   - Keep source documents visible for reference

3. Quality control:
   - Read each insight aloud to check clarity
   - Ensure handwriting is legible from 3 feet away
   - Add source abbreviation to each note
```

**Phase 2: CLUSTER**
```
1. Move all insights to large clustering area
2. Start with silent individual clustering (10 minutes):
   - Each person identifies 3-5 potential clusters
   - No discussion during initial grouping
3. Group clustering discussion:
   - Compare different clustering approaches
   - Negotiate cluster boundaries through discussion
   - Move insights between clusters as patterns emerge
4. Use different colored tape to circle clusters
```

**Phase 3: THEME**
```
1. Write theme headers on different colored notes
2. Place theme header at top of each cluster
3. Create theme description on flip chart paper
4. Test theme names by reading aloud with all insights
5. Take photos of each cluster with theme header visible
```

**Phase 4: SYNTHESIZE**
```
1. Step back from wall to see full pattern
2. Use flip chart to map theme relationships
3. Create priority ranking by moving most important themes higher on wall
4. Use different colored markers to draw connections between themes
5. Document final synthesis on flip chart pages
```

### Documentation Strategy
```
Photo Documentation:
- Overview shot of entire wall
- Individual cluster photos with theme headers
- Close-ups of key insights that were hard to read
- Final synthesis mapping and relationships

Digital Backup:
- Type up themes and key insights within 24 hours
- Create digital version of synthesis for sharing
- Scan or photograph any flip chart documentation
- Store source documents with photo references
```
