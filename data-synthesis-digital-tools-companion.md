# üíª Digital vs Physical Tools Companion

Platform-specific setup instructions and collaboration strategies for Miro, Mural, sticky notes, and hybrid approaches that preserve synthesis quality across methods.

---

## üéØ Quick Method Selection

| **Physical (Sticky Notes)** | **Digital (Miro/Mural)** | **Hybrid** |
|---|---|---|
| ‚úÖ In-person teams | ‚úÖ Remote collaboration | ‚úÖ Mixed tech comfort |
| ‚úÖ Tactile learners | ‚úÖ Large datasets (50+ insights) | ‚úÖ Community + team phases |
| ‚úÖ Limited tech access | ‚úÖ Easy sharing/documentation | ‚úÖ Best of both approaches |

**Requirements Check:**
- **Physical**: Wall space (6-8 feet), colored sticky notes, thick markers, camera
- **Digital**: Internet, platform account, computer/tablet, video conferencing
- **Hybrid**: Both sets of requirements plus integration workflow

---

## üìù Physical Method Setup

### Essential Materials & Layout
```
Materials Checklist:
‚ñ° Colored sticky notes (Yellow: quotes, Pink: interpretations, Blue: research, Green: questions)
‚ñ° Thick markers, masking tape, timer, camera
‚ñ° Wall space (6-8 feet) or flip chart pages

Layout: Capture (left) ‚Üí Clustering (center) ‚Üí Themes (right) ‚Üí Parking lot (bottom)
```

### Process Keys
```
CAPTURE: One insight per note, legible writing, source attribution
CLUSTER: Silent individual (10 min) ‚Üí Group discussion ‚Üí Negotiate boundaries
THEME: Headers on colored notes, test by reading aloud, photograph each cluster
SYNTHESIZE: Step back for patterns, map relationships, prioritize themes
```

### Documentation Essentials
- **Photos**: Overview + individual clusters + close-ups of key insights
- **Digital backup**: Type themes within 24 hours, scan flip charts

## üåê Platform-Specific Setup Guides

### Miro Workflow
```
Board Setup:
- Template areas: CAPTURE (left) ‚Üí CLUSTERING (center) ‚Üí THEMES (right) ‚Üí SYNTHESIS (bottom)
- Color-coded sticky note templates with source attribution
- Upload source documents for reference

Key Features:
- Frames for cluster grouping (better than moving individual notes)
- Voting dots for prioritization
- Comments for team discussion
- Connector lines for theme relationships
- Export as PDF, use presentation mode for review

Collaboration Process:
- Divide source documents among team members
- Use @mentions for flagged insights
- Real-time clustering with comment threads
- Text boxes for theme headers and descriptions
```

### Mural Workflow
```
Advantages:
- LUMA affinity mapping templates
- Timer for time-boxed phases
- Private mode for individual work ‚Üí collaborative mode for group discussion
- Summon feature for attention, outline mode for documentation

Setup:
- Area templates for clear process spaces
- Parking lot for questions/contradictions
- Color coding legend

Process:
- Private capture ‚Üí collaborative clustering ‚Üí outline for themes
- Export outline as structured document
```

### FigJam Workflow
```
Best For:
- Teams using Figma design workflows
- Mobile community participation (strong mobile app)
- Voice notes for preserving stakeholder audio

Setup:
- Section tools for process areas
- Component library of sticky templates
- Collaborative cursors for team awareness
- Reaction emojis for quick prioritization
```

## ü§ù Team Collaboration Essentials

### Remote Team Setup
```
Pre-Session Check (30 min before):
‚ñ° Platform access tested for all participants
‚ñ° Screen sharing, audio/video quality confirmed
‚ñ° Source documents uploaded and accessible
‚ñ° Role assignments: Facilitator, Scribe, Integrator, Community Advocate

Session Management:
- Use platform timers, bio breaks every 45 minutes
- Rotate screen control among team members
- Platform-specific features: Miro voting/cursor chat, Mural summon/private mode
- Backup plan for technical issues
```

### Hybrid Physical-Digital Teams
```
Setup Requirements:
- Camera showing wall/workspace, high-quality microphone
- Screen showing digital board to physical participants
- Designated person to relay remote input

Process Flow:
- Physical team on sticky notes ‚Üí Digital transcription in real-time
- Physical clustering ‚Üí Digital recreation ‚Üí Remote input via chat/voice
- Combined theme development ‚Üí Digital documentation for all access
```

## üìä Quality Standards & Troubleshooting

### Universal Quality Checklist
```
‚ñ° Stakeholder voice preserved regardless of method
‚ñ° All major data sources represented in themes
‚ñ° Insights traceable back to original sources
‚ñ° Themes suggest clear, actionable next steps
‚ñ° Synthesis connects to Problem Tree and project goals
```

### Method-Specific Quality Checks
```
Physical Method:
‚ñ° Insights legible from 3 feet away
‚ñ° Source attribution clear on each note
‚ñ° Photos sufficient for digital recreation

Digital Method:
‚ñ° All team members can edit and contribute
‚ñ° Source tags clear and consistent
‚ñ° Final version clearly marked and backed up
```

### Common Issues & Quick Fixes
```
Physical Problems:
- Sticky notes won't stay ‚Üí Use masking tape frames or flip chart paper
- Illegible handwriting ‚Üí Thicker markers, designated scribe, photo backup
- Space limitations ‚Üí Multiple flip charts, work in sections

Digital Problems:
- Platform access ‚Üí Test 24hrs before, backup accounts, alternative platform ready
- Connectivity issues ‚Üí Mobile hotspot backup, reduce video quality, save frequently
- Interface overwhelm ‚Üí Simplified templates, pre-session tutorial, assign navigator
```
