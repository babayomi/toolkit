# ðŸ§  Model Context Prompt - MCP

### Step 1: Create Your Research Plan

Before using AI, establish your research framework:

**Define Your Scope:**

*   What specific problem are you investigating?
*   Who is the affected population?
*   What geographic area?
*   What time frame?

**Set Research Objectives:**

*   Understand likely root causes and effects
*   Identify common indicators and measurement approaches
*   Find credible sources for deeper reading
*   Surface knowledge gaps and assumptions
*   Prepare questions for stakeholder validation

**Plan Documentation:**

*   How will you track sources and citations?
*   Where will you store evidence vs. assumptions?
*   How will you organize findings for team review?

### Step 2: Build Your MCP (Model Context Protocol) Prompt

The MCP structure ensures your AI assistant provides systematic, high-quality outputs:

#### 2.1 System Context Block

```
You are an evidence-focused research assistant for nonprofits/social enterprises.
Behaviors: neutral, transparent, concise. Cite publisher + year. Prefer reputable 
sources (UN agencies, government statistics, multilaterals, peer-reviewed). 
Separate facts from assumptions. Flag uncertainties and potential bias.
```

#### 2.2 Knowledge Context Block

```
Draft core problem: [Your one-line problem statement]
Scope/Context: [Geography, population, timeframe if relevant]
What we already know: 
- [Existing insight 1 with source if available]
- [Existing insight 2]
- [Existing insight 3]
Keywords/aliases: [Related terms and concepts]
```

#### 2.3 Task Context Block

```
Objectives:
1) Propose a Preliminary Problem Tree: core problem; 2-3 levels of root causes; key effects
2) Suggest common indicators that evidence each cause/effect (name â€¢ unit â€¢ typical sources)
3) Provide 5-10 credible sources to read next (publisher â€¢ year â€¢ link if available)
4) List uncertainties/gaps and assumptions that need field validation
5) Draft 10 stakeholder research questions to validate and deepen understanding
```

#### 2.4 Prompt Block

```
Using the contexts above, produce:
- A **Preliminary Problem Tree** in markdown bullets
- A table of **indicators** (Indicator â€¢ What it measures â€¢ Possible sources)
- A **Reading list** (publisher â€¢ year â€¢ link if available)
- **Uncertainties & assumptions** (bullets)
- **10 stakeholder questions**
```

### Step 3: Run and Quality-Check AI Output

- Execute prompt in AI assistant
- Systematically review outputs
- Verify source credibility
- Cross-reference information

### Step 4: Build Preliminary Problem Tree

- Organize core problem, root causes, and effects
- Tag items as evidence-based or assumptions
- Document citations
- Prepare for stakeholder validation
