## üè≠ Sector-Specific Use Cases

<div class="problem-tree-embed">
  <div class="problem-tree-title">üíº Youth Employment Initiative Example</div>
  <div class="problem-tree-description">Complete affinity analysis flow showing stakeholder engagement to refined themes with Problem Tree updates</div>
  
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/affinity-analysis/youth-employment-usecase.svg' | relative_url }}" alt="Youth Employment affinity analysis showing stakeholder groups, initial clusters, refined themes, and Problem Tree validation updates" style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">

    <a href="{{ '/assets/images/affinity-analysis/youth-employment-usecase.svg' | relative_url }}" target="_blank" class="enlarge-link">üîç Enlarge to view</a>
  </div>
</div>

### Use Case 1: Youth Employment Initiative

**Context:** Urban/rural youth unemployment with skills mismatch issues

**Data Sources:**
- 15 youth interviews (ages 18-25)
- 8 employer interviews (various sectors)
- 3 focus groups (rural, urban, women)
- Government employment statistics
- 5 NGO partner consultations

**Sample Theme Evolution:**

**Initial Clusters:**
- "Skills problems" (8 insights)
- "Transport issues" (6 insights)  
- "Money problems" (12 insights)
- "Family stuff" (5 insights)

**Refined Themes:**
- **"Skills-Market Disconnect"**: Training programs don't match employer needs
- **"Geographic Access Barriers"**: Distance and transport costs prevent opportunity access
- **"Financial Exclusion Cycle"**: Need money to make money, but no access to capital
- **"Cultural and Gender Expectations"**: Family pressure affects career choices differently by gender

**Problem Tree Updates:**
- Added: "Previous program failures created stakeholder skepticism" (new root cause)
- Refined: "Limited access to training" ‚Üí "Training exists but disconnected from market needs"
- Validated: Geographic barriers assumption with specific transport cost data

<div class="problem-tree-embed">
  <div class="problem-tree-title">üè• Community Health Improvement Example</div>
  <div class="problem-tree-description">Healthcare access barriers analysis showing multi-stakeholder synthesis and evidence assessment</div>

  </div>
</div>

### Use Case 2: Community Health Improvement

**Context:** Maternal and child health outcomes in underserved communities

**Data Sources:**
- 12 mother interviews
- 6 community health worker interviews
- 4 healthcare provider consultations
- Health facility assessment data
- 2 community leader focus groups

**Sample Theme Development:**

**Cluster Example: Healthcare Access Issues**
```
Initial insights:
- "Clinic is too far when baby is sick"
- "Can't afford transport to health center"
- "Clinic only open when I'm working"
- "No childcare during appointments"
- "Traditional healer is closer and cheaper"

Refined Theme: "Healthcare Access Barriers: Distance, Cost, and Cultural Factors"
Description: Multiple interconnected barriers prevent consistent healthcare access, 
with families making rational choices based on immediate constraints rather than 
optimal health outcomes.

Problem Tree Impact: Added new root cause about accessibility vs availability
```

<div class="problem-tree-embed">
  <div class="problem-tree-title">üéì Education Quality Initiative Example</div>
  <div class="problem-tree-description">Cross-cultural synthesis showing how multiple stakeholder perspectives converge into unified themes</div>
  
  <img src="{{ '/assets/images/affinity-analysis/education-quality-usecase.svg' | relative_url }}" alt="Education Quality affinity analysis showing multi-stakeholder perspectives converging into cross-cultural synthesis with action implications" style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px;">

    <a href="{{ '/assets/images/affinity-analysis/education-quality-usecase.svg' | relative_url }}" target="_blank" class="enlarge-link">üîç Enlarge to view</a>
  </div>
</div>

### Use Case 3: Education Quality Initiative

**Context:** Primary education outcomes and community engagement

**Data Sources:**
- 20 parent interviews
- 8 teacher interviews
- 3 student focus groups
- School performance data analysis
- 4 community leader consultations

**Cross-Cultural Synthesis Example:**
```
Theme: "Language and Cultural Disconnect in Curriculum"

Urban parents: "School teaches in English but kids speak local language at home"
Rural parents: "Teachers don't understand our children's background"
Teachers: "Curriculum doesn't reflect student experiences"
Students: "Stories in books are about places we've never seen"

Synthesis insight: Language policy affects learning, but deeper issue is cultural 
relevance of content and teaching methods that don't build on student assets.
```

## üîÑ Template Adaptation Guidelines

### For Different Data Volumes

**Small Dataset (5-15 stakeholders):**
- Use simplified clustering approach
- Focus on 3-5 major themes
- Emphasize depth over breadth
- Include more detailed quotes

**Large Dataset (50+ stakeholders):**
- Use sub-sampling for initial analysis
- Create theme hierarchies (themes and sub-themes)
- Use digital tools for efficiency
- Focus on pattern strength

### For Different Stakeholder Types

**Homogeneous Group (similar backgrounds):**
- Look for subtle differences within apparent consensus
- Pay attention to intensity variations
- Examine what's not said as much as what is
- Consider if missing perspectives need follow-up

**Diverse Group (different backgrounds):**
- Map themes by stakeholder characteristics
- Look for bridges and tensions between groups
- Pay attention to power dynamics in theme emergence
- Ensure marginalized voices aren't overwhelmed

### For Different Problem Types

**Technical/Systems Issues:**
- Focus on process and mechanism insights
- Map stakeholder themes to system components
- Look for leverage points and intervention opportunities
- Connect to existing system maps or frameworks

**Social/Cultural Issues:**
- Pay special attention to language and framing
- Look for value-based themes and cultural patterns
- Consider historical and contextual factors
- Map themes to social network or relationship patterns

## üéØ Common Adaptations by Context

### Remote/Digital Synthesis
- Use collaborative online tools (Miro, Mural)
- Record video synthesis sessions for reference
- Create shared documents for real-time collaboration
- Schedule multiple shorter sessions vs single long session

### Low-Literacy Communities
- Use visual symbols and pictures in addition to text
- Focus on verbal processing with audio recordings
- Include visual mapping of themes
- Work with community interpreters for language nuance

### Cross-Cultural Teams
- Include cultural interpretation in synthesis process
- Discuss cultural assumptions before clustering
- Allow time for cultural context explanation
- Include cultural mediators in theme validation

### Resource-Constrained Settings
- Use simple physical materials (paper, markers)
- Focus on essential themes only
- Combine synthesis with other project activities
- Leverage existing community meeting structures
