# üõó Problem Tree Accessibility Companion

Ensure your problem analysis is inclusive and considers accessibility needs throughout the process, creating solutions that work for everyone, including people with disabilities and marginalized communities.

---

## üéØ Why Accessibility Matters in Problem Analysis

### The Hidden 15%
- **1 billion people worldwide** live with some form of disability
- **80% live in developing countries** where social programs operate
- **Often excluded** from mainstream problem analysis and solution design
- **Disproportionately affected** by many social challenges

### The Multiplication Effect
When you design for accessibility:
- **Solutions work better for everyone** (universal design principle)
- **Reach broader populations** and create greater impact
- **Meet funding requirements** (many funders now require accessibility considerations)
- **Build more sustainable programs** that truly serve communities

## ‚ôø Accessibility Lens for Each Problem Tree Component

### üå≥ Core Problem Analysis

#### Accessibility Questions for Problem Definition
**Standard Question:** "What is the main problem affecting our target population?"

**Accessibility-Enhanced Questions:**
- How does this problem **differently affect** people with disabilities?
- Are there **accessibility barriers** that make this problem worse for some people?
- Do our **data sources** include perspectives from people with disabilities?
- Are we **missing subgroups** who experience this problem differently?

#### Example: Education Access Problem

**Standard Core Problem:**
"Children in rural areas have limited access to quality primary education due to teacher shortages and inadequate facilities."

**Accessibility-Enhanced Core Problem:**
"Children in rural areas, including those with disabilities, learning differences, and diverse cultural backgrounds, have limited access to inclusive quality primary education due to teacher shortages, inadequate facilities, and lack of accommodations for diverse learning needs."

### üå± Root Cause Analysis with Accessibility Focus

#### Physical Accessibility Causes
- **Infrastructure barriers**: Steps, narrow doorways, poor lighting
- **Transportation barriers**: Inaccessible public transport, long distances
- **Communication barriers**: No sign language, no materials in alternative formats

#### Social Accessibility Causes
- **Attitudinal barriers**: Stigma, discrimination, low expectations
- **Policy barriers**: Exclusionary laws, lack of inclusive policies
- **Economic barriers**: Additional costs for accommodations, assistive devices

#### Information Accessibility Causes
- **Format barriers**: Text-only materials, no visual aids, complex language
- **Language barriers**: Single language, no translation services
- **Technology barriers**: Incompatible with assistive technologies

### üåø Effects Analysis Through Accessibility Lens

#### Compounding Effects
Inaccessible solutions often create **multiplier effects**:
- Initial problem ‚Üí Accessibility barrier ‚Üí **Deeper exclusion**
- Limited options ‚Üí Forced dependence ‚Üí **Loss of autonomy** 
- Social isolation ‚Üí Mental health impacts ‚Üí **Reduced participation**

## üîç Accessibility Assessment Framework

### Step 1: Stakeholder Inclusion Check

#### Representation Audit
**Physical Disabilities:**
- ‚úÖ Mobility impairments (wheelchair users, walking difficulties)
- ‚úÖ Sensory impairments (blind, low vision, deaf, hard of hearing)
- ‚úÖ Hidden disabilities (chronic illness, fatigue, pain conditions)

**Cognitive and Learning Differences:**
- ‚úÖ Intellectual disabilities
- ‚úÖ Learning disabilities (dyslexia, ADHD)
- ‚úÖ Autism spectrum conditions
- ‚úÖ Mental health conditions

**Intersectional Considerations:**
- ‚úÖ Age + disability (elderly with impairments, children with disabilities)
- ‚úÖ Gender + disability (women/girls with disabilities face double discrimination)
- ‚úÖ Poverty + disability (higher rates of poverty among people with disabilities)
- ‚úÖ Rural + disability (limited services, greater isolation)

### Step 2: Data Collection Accessibility

#### Accessible Research Methods
**Surveys and Questionnaires:**
- Provide multiple formats (large print, braille, audio, digital)
- Use plain language and clear instructions
- Allow extended time for completion
- Offer assistance without compromising privacy

**Interviews and Focus Groups:**
- Choose accessible venues with ramps, parking, accessible bathrooms
- Provide sign language interpreters when needed
- Allow communication devices and personal assistants
- Use inclusive language and person-first terminology

**Community Meetings:**
- Schedule at accessible times and locations
- Provide multiple ways to participate (in-person, phone, online)
- Use microphones and hearing loops
- Provide materials in advance in multiple formats

### Step 3: Solution Design Accessibility

#### Universal Design Principles in Problem Trees
1. **Equitable use**: Solutions usable by people with diverse abilities
2. **Flexibility in use**: Multiple ways to access and participate
3. **Simple and intuitive**: Easy to understand regardless of language or experience
4. **Perceptible information**: Communicated effectively to all users
5. **Tolerance for error**: Minimize hazards of accidental actions
6. **Low physical effort**: Efficient and comfortable to use
7. **Size and space**: Appropriate for approach and use

## üåç Accessibility Examples by Sector

### Health Sector: Maternal Health Access

**Standard Problem Analysis:**
- Core problem: Limited prenatal care in rural areas
- Root causes: Distance to clinics, shortage of healthcare workers
- Effects: Higher maternal and infant mortality

**Accessibility-Enhanced Analysis:**
- **Additional root causes**: 
  - Clinics lack wheelchair accessibility
  - No sign language interpreters for deaf women
  - Health information not available in braille or simple language
  - Stigma toward women with disabilities having children

- **Additional effects**:
  - Women with disabilities more likely to experience complications
  - Forced sterilizations due to disability stigma
  - Higher rates of depression due to social isolation

### Education Sector: School Participation

**Standard Problem Analysis:**
- Core problem: Low school enrollment in marginalized communities
- Root causes: Poverty, child labor, cultural barriers
- Effects: Limited future opportunities, perpetuation of poverty cycles

**Accessibility-Enhanced Analysis:**
- **Additional root causes**:
  - Schools physically inaccessible to children with mobility impairments
  - Teachers untrained in inclusive education methods
  - No materials in alternative formats for children with visual impairments
  - Bullying and stigma toward children with disabilities

- **Additional effects**:
  - Children with disabilities experience higher dropout rates
  - Reduced employment opportunities in adulthood
  - Increased dependence on family and social services

### Economic Development: Microfinance Access

**Standard Problem Analysis:**
- Core problem: Limited access to credit for small business development
- Root causes: Lack of collateral, limited financial literacy, gender discrimination
- Effects: Reduced economic opportunities, perpetuation of poverty

**Accessibility-Enhanced Analysis:**
- **Additional root causes**:
  - Bank branches not physically accessible
  - Financial education materials not available in accessible formats
  - Discrimination against people with disabilities as "poor credit risks"
  - Assumption that people with disabilities cannot run successful businesses

- **Additional effects**:
  - People with disabilities more likely to live in extreme poverty
  - Reduced economic participation and contribution to community
  - Increased reliance on social protection systems
