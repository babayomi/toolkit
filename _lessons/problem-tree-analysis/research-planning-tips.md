# 📏 Research Planning Tips

Strategic approaches to conducting thorough, efficient research that strengthens your problem tree while making smart use of your time and resources.

---

## 🎯 Research Strategy Framework

### The 80/20 Research Principle
**80% of insights** come from **20% of well-chosen sources**

**High-Impact Research Sources:**
- Government statistical reports (census, sector-specific data)
- Recent academic systematic reviews and meta-analyses  
- Major NGO/UN agency reports on your topic
- Direct stakeholder interviews with affected populations
- Local expert consultations

**Lower-Impact Research Sources:**
- Individual studies without peer review
- Outdated reports (>5 years in fast-changing contexts)
- Opinion pieces without data backing
- Sources not specific to your geographic/demographic context

---

## 📊 Research Planning by Problem Tree Component

### 🌳 Core Problem Research

#### Essential Data Points to Gather
1. **Scale and Scope**
   - How many people are affected?
   - Geographic distribution of the problem
   - Demographic breakdown (age, gender, income, etc.)
   - Trend data (getting better/worse over time?)

2. **Problem Severity**  
   - Quantitative indicators (mortality, morbidity, income levels, test scores)
   - Qualitative impact descriptions (how it affects daily life)
   - Comparison to national/regional/global averages
   - Cost estimates (economic impact of the problem)

#### Research Methods for Core Problem
**Desk Research (2-4 hours):**
- National census data and government statistics
- World Bank, UN, WHO country-specific reports
- Academic literature reviews on your topic
- Recent evaluation reports from similar programs

**Field Research (4-8 hours):**
- Key informant interviews with local experts (3-5 people)
- Focus group with affected population (6-12 participants)
- Direct observation in problem context
- Photo/video documentation where appropriate

### 🌱 Root Cause Research

#### Research Questions by Cause Type
**Immediate Causes** (What's happening now?)
- What behaviors or actions directly create the problem?
- What systems or processes are failing?
- What resources or capacities are missing?

**Underlying Drivers** (Why are immediate causes happening?)
- What motivates or constrains current behaviors?
- What historical factors created current systems?
- What policies or governance structures shape the context?

**Systemic Factors** (What maintains the status quo?)
- What power dynamics benefit from current situation?
- What cultural norms or beliefs support current patterns?
- What economic or political structures perpetuate the problem?

#### Root Cause Research Strategy
**Start with "Five Whys" Literature Review:**
1. Search for research on immediate causes
2. Look for studies explaining underlying drivers  
3. Find analysis of systemic and structural factors
4. Identify contradictory evidence or alternative explanations
5. Note gaps where stakeholder input is essential

### 🌿 Effects Research

#### Types of Effects to Research
**Primary Effects** (Direct consequences)
- Health impacts (morbidity, mortality, quality of life)
- Economic impacts (income loss, increased costs, productivity)
- Social impacts (relationships, participation, status)
- Educational impacts (learning, skills, opportunities)

**Secondary Effects** (Ripple consequences)  
- Family and household impacts
- Community-level effects
- Economic system impacts
- Intergenerational consequences

#### Effects Research Approach
**Quantitative Effects:**
- Search for studies measuring costs and impacts
- Look for economic evaluations and burden of disease studies
- Find longitudinal studies showing long-term consequences
- Identify proxy indicators when direct measures aren't available

**Qualitative Effects:**
- Interview people experiencing the problem about consequences
- Ask community leaders about broader impacts
- Consult service providers about what they observe
- Document stories and case examples

## 🔍 Efficient Research Techniques

### The Research Sprint Method (6-8 hours total)

#### Hour 1-2: Rapid Landscape Scan
**Goal:** Get overall picture and identify key sources
- Google Scholar search with key terms + your location
- Check major databases (PubMed for health, ERIC for education, EconLit for economics)
- Scan reference lists of most relevant papers for additional sources
- Identify 2-3 local experts to interview

#### Hour 3-4: Deep Dive on Best Sources
**Goal:** Extract specific data for your problem tree
- Read abstracts of 15-20 papers, full text of 3-5 best ones
- Take structured notes using problem tree template
- Document statistics, quotes, and key findings
- Note methodology quality and geographic relevance

#### Hour 5-6: Stakeholder Validation Calls
**Goal:** Test and refine your understanding
- 3-4 brief calls (20 minutes each) with local experts
- Ask specific questions about your findings
- Test your draft problem tree components
- Get recommendations for additional sources

#### Hour 7-8: Synthesis and Gap Analysis  
**Goal:** Finalize research foundation
- Complete first draft of evidence-based problem tree
- Identify remaining evidence gaps
- Prioritize which gaps need additional research
- Document assumptions that need stakeholder validation

### AI-Enhanced Research Tips

#### Strategic AI Use for Problem Tree Research
**Good AI Applications:**
- Literature search and summarization
- Initial data analysis and pattern identification
- Translation of research from other languages
- Comparative analysis across countries or contexts

**AI Limitations to Remember:**
- May not have access to most recent data
- Can miss local context and cultural nuances
- Cannot replace direct stakeholder consultation
- May contain biases from training data

**Best Practice:** Use AI for **speed and breadth**, validate with **human expertise and local knowledge**

## 📚 Source Quality Assessment

### Academic Source Evaluation

#### Tier 1 Sources (Highest Quality)
- **Systematic reviews and meta-analyses** in reputable journals
- **Peer-reviewed studies** with large sample sizes and robust methodology
- **Government statistical reports** with transparent methodology
- **Major international organization reports** (World Bank, UN agencies, WHO)

#### Tier 2 Sources (Good Quality)
- **Peer-reviewed individual studies** with smaller samples
- **Reports from established NGOs** with good research reputation
- **Government policy documents** with evidence base
- **Evaluation reports** from credible evaluation organizations

#### Tier 3 Sources (Use with Caution)
- **Working papers** and conference presentations (not peer-reviewed)
- **Advocacy organization reports** (may have bias)
- **Media reports** (useful for current events, but verify facts)
- **Blog posts and opinion pieces** (for perspectives, not facts)

### Geographic and Temporal Relevance

#### Context Matching Checklist
- **Geographic relevance**: Same country > same region > similar development level
- **Temporal relevance**: Within 5 years > within 10 years > older with caution
- **Population relevance**: Same demographic group > similar characteristics > different groups
- **Sectoral relevance**: Same sector > related sectors > different sectors

### Sample Size and Methodology Red Flags
- **Sample sizes too small** for generalizable conclusions
- **Methodology not described** or unclear
- **Conflict of interest** not disclosed  
- **Cherry-picked data** without discussing limitations
- **Correlation presented as causation** without proper analysis

## ⏰ Time Management for Research

### Research Time Allocation

**For Simple, Well-Documented Problems (8-10 hours):**
- 30% Desktop research (3 hours)
- 40% Stakeholder consultation (4 hours)  
- 30% Analysis and synthesis (3 hours)

**For Complex, Under-Researched Problems (15-20 hours):**
- 40% Desktop research (6-8 hours)
- 35% Stakeholder consultation (5-7 hours)
- 25% Analysis and synthesis (4-5 hours)

### Research Stopping Rules
**Stop desktop research when:**
- Same information appears in 3+ sources
- You've identified all major stakeholder categories
- You have quantitative data on scale and qualitative data on impact
- Additional sources don't provide new insights

**Stop stakeholder consultation when:**
- Similar themes emerge across multiple conversations
- You've spoken with representatives from all major stakeholder groups
- New interviews confirm rather than challenge existing understanding
- You have sufficient detail for problem tree validation
