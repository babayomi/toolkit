# üß† Model Context Protocol - MCP

Leverage AI-enhanced research methods to accelerate problem tree analysis while maintaining analytical rigor. Learn to use AI as a strategic research partner, not a replacement for critical thinking.

---

## ü§ñ What is Model Context Protocol?

### MCP Defined
Model Context Protocol is a **structured framework for interacting with AI systems** to get more accurate, comprehensive, and useful responses for research and analysis tasks. Instead of simple prompts, MCP uses detailed context setting, specific instructions, and quality parameters.

### Why MCP for Problem Trees?
- **Accelerates research** from weeks to hours
- **Identifies blind spots** you might miss
- **Provides global perspective** on local problems  
- **Generates hypotheses** for stakeholder validation
- **Maintains quality control** through structured prompts

## RESEARCH PARAMETERS
- Impact scope: Include individual, household, community, and system effects
- Time horizon: Analyze both immediate and long-term consequences
- Evidence types: Combine quantitative measures with qualitative impacts
- Interconnections: Show how effects compound and create other problems

## ANALYSIS QUERIES
1. "What are the immediate, direct effects of [PROBLEM] on affected populations? Include health, economic, social, and educational impacts with specific measures where available."

2. "What are the secondary and ripple effects on families, communities, and broader systems? Include unintended consequences and multiplier effects."

3. "How do these effects compound over time and across generations? Include lifecycle impacts and intergenerational transmission."

4. "What are the economic costs and implications of these effects? Include direct costs, opportunity costs, and broader economic impacts."

5. "How do these effects create or worsen other social problems? Map interconnections with other development challenges."

## OUTPUT FORMAT
- Primary Effects: Direct consequences with quantification
- Secondary Effects: Ripple impacts organized by level (household, community, system)
- Long-term Consequences: Trajectory analysis and intergenerational impacts
- Economic Analysis: Cost estimates and economic burden
- Problem Interconnections: How this connects to other challenges
```

## üîç Advanced MCP Techniques

### Comparative Analysis MCP

#### Multi-Country Comparison
```
"Compare how [PROBLEM] manifests differently across [COUNTRY A], [COUNTRY B], and [COUNTRY C]. What factors explain these differences? What lessons from successful interventions in one context might apply to others?"
```

#### Historical Comparison
```
"How has the approach to addressing [PROBLEM] evolved over the past 20 years globally? What strategies have been tried, what worked, what failed, and what lessons can inform current intervention design?"
```

### Stakeholder Perspective MCP

#### Multi-Stakeholder Analysis
```
"Analyze [PROBLEM] from the perspectives of: 1) Affected populations, 2) Service providers, 3) Government officials, 4) Private sector, 5) Civil society. Where do they agree and disagree about causes and solutions?"
```

#### Power Dynamics Analysis
```
"Who has power to influence [PROBLEM] and how? Map formal authority, informal influence, resource control, and agenda-setting power. Who benefits from the status quo and who would benefit from change?"
```

## ‚úÖ Quality Control for AI Research

### Validation Checklist

#### Source Quality Assessment
- [ ] AI cited credible sources (government, academic, international organizations)
- [ ] Sources are recent and relevant to your context
- [ ] Multiple sources support key claims
- [ ] AI noted limitations and data gaps

#### Analysis Quality Assessment  
- [ ] Distinguishes correlation from causation appropriately
- [ ] Acknowledges complexity and nuance
- [ ] Includes multiple perspectives and viewpoints
- [ ] Identifies areas needing stakeholder validation

#### Contextual Relevance Assessment
- [ ] Information is specific to your geographic context
- [ ] Demographic relevance matches your target population
- [ ] Cultural and political context considerations included
- [ ] Local factors and constraints acknowledged

### Red Flags in AI Responses
- **Generic information** not specific to your context
- **Oversimplified explanations** of complex problems
- **Missing caveats** about data limitations or uncertainty
- **Biased perspectives** without acknowledging other viewpoints
- **Outdated information** presented as current
