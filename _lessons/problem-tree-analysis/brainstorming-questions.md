# ‚ùì Problem Tree Brainstorming Questions

Essential questions to guide your thinking and uncover hidden aspects of complex problems. Use these structured inquiry methods to dig deeper into root causes and identify effects you might otherwise miss.

## üß† The Power of Strategic Questioning

### Why Questions Matter More Than Answers
- **Reveal assumptions** you didn't know you were making
- **Uncover blind spots** in your analysis  
- **Challenge conventional thinking** about problems and solutions
- **Guide research direction** toward most important insights
- **Prepare you for stakeholder conversations** with meaningful inquiries

## üå≥ Core Problem Definition Questions

### Problem Clarity Questions
1. **What exactly is the problem?** Can you describe it in one clear sentence?
2. **Who specifically experiences this problem?** Demographics, location, circumstances?
3. **When does this problem occur?** Timing, frequency, patterns?
4. **Where does this problem happen?** Geographic, institutional, social contexts?
5. **How severe is this problem?** Scale, intensity, urgency?

### Problem Boundaries Questions
6. **What is NOT the problem?** What related issues are you excluding and why?
7. **What would success look like?** How would you know if this problem were solved?
8. **Whose problem is this?** Who considers this urgent vs. those who don't?
9. **What happens if nothing changes?** Trajectory if no intervention occurs?
10. **How long has this been a problem?** Historical context and evolution?

18. **What historical factors created these conditions?** Legacy issues, past policies, cultural factors

**Level 3 - Root Systems**
19. **What power dynamics maintain this problem?** Who benefits from status quo?

## üó£Ô∏è Stakeholder Engagement Questions

### Community Validation Questions
Use these when engaging communities to validate your problem tree:

**Opening Questions:**
55. **"Does this problem description match your experience?"** Validation of core problem
56. **"What would you add or change about how we've described this?"** Community refinement
57. **"Are there important causes we've missed?"** Root cause gaps
58. **"Do you see other effects we haven't mentioned?"** Impact completeness

**Deeper Exploration:**
59. **"Can you tell us about a time when this problem affected you personally?"** Concrete examples
60. **"What makes this problem worse or better at different times?"** Situational factors
61. **"If you could change one thing about this situation, what would it be?"** Priority identification
62. **"What have you or others tried before to deal with this?"** Previous attempts and lessons
