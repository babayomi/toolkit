# 🎯 Converting Assumptions to Stakeholder Questions

Transform your analytical assumptions into meaningful questions for community engagement. Bridge the gap between desk research and lived experience by preparing strategic questions that validate, challenge, and refine your problem tree.

## 🤔 Understanding the Assumption Challenge

### Why Assumptions Are Inevitable
- **Limited data** forces logical inferences
- **External perspectives** may miss local nuances
- **Research gaps** require educated guessing
- **Causal complexity** involves multiple possible explanations
- **Time constraints** prevent exhaustive investigation

### Why Assumptions Are Dangerous
- **Wrong assumptions** lead to ineffective solutions
- **Unvalidated assumptions** create stakeholder resistance
- **Hidden assumptions** prevent learning and adaptation
- **Biased assumptions** exclude important voices
- **Assumption stacking** compounds errors exponentially

### The Solution: Systematic Validation
Convert every significant assumption into **testable questions** for stakeholder engagement, creating a bridge between research and reality.

## 🔄 The Assumption-to-Question Process

### Step 1: Assumption Identification

#### Common Assumption Categories in Problem Trees

**Scale and Scope Assumptions:**
- "This affects X number of people"
- "The problem is getting worse/better"
- "Rural areas are more affected than urban"
- "Women experience this differently than men"

**Causal Assumptions:**
- "A leads to B because of mechanism C"
- "This is the primary/secondary cause"
- "Addressing X will reduce Y"
- "Multiple causes interact in this specific way"

**Priority and Impact Assumptions:**
- "This cause is more important than others"
- "People care most about this aspect"
- "The community is ready for this type of intervention"
- "This effect is the most serious consequence"

**Context Assumptions:**
- "Local culture supports/opposes certain approaches"
- "Government policy helps/hinders in these ways"
- "Economic constraints operate like this"
- "Social norms influence behavior in predictable ways"

### Step 2: Question Transformation Framework

#### The OPEN Question Formula
**O**pen-ended: Allows for unexpected responses  
**P**articular: Specific to stakeholder experience  
**E**xploratory: Invites elaboration and examples  
**N**eutral: Doesn't lead toward desired answer

#### Transformation Examples

**Assumption → Question Transformation**

*Assumption:* "Women have less access to credit than men"
*Weak Question:* "Do women have trouble getting credit?"
*Strong Question:* "Can you walk me through what happens when someone in your community wants to borrow money? How might that experience be different for men and women?"

*Assumption:* "Distance to health facilities is a major barrier"
*Weak Question:* "Is distance to the clinic a problem?"
*Strong Question:* "Tell me about the last time someone in your family needed healthcare. What was that journey like from start to finish?"

*Assumption:* "Youth prefer modern farming methods"
*Weak Question:* "Do young people like new farming techniques?"
*Strong Question:* "When young people in this area think about farming, what attracts them to it? What concerns them? How do they approach farming decisions differently than their parents?"

## 📋 Question Categories and Templates

### 🌳 Core Problem Validation Questions

#### Problem Definition Validation
**Assumption Category:** Problem definition and scope
**Question Templates:**

1. **Experience Validation**
   "Can you describe a time when [PROBLEM AREA] affected you or your family? What was that experience like?"

2. **Priority Validation**
   "When you think about the biggest challenges in this community, what comes to mind first? How would you rank [YOUR PROBLEM] compared to other issues?"

3. **Manifestation Validation**
   "How does [PROBLEM AREA] show up in daily life here? What does it look like when it's happening?"

4. **Change Over Time**
   "How has [PROBLEM AREA] changed in this community over the past few years? What do you think has driven those changes?"

### 🌱 Root Cause Validation Questions

#### Causal Logic Testing
**Assumption Category:** Cause-effect relationships
**Question Templates:**

1. **Causal Chain Exploration**
   "In your experience, what leads to [PROBLEM]? Can you walk me through how that happens?"

2. **Multiple Cause Investigation**
   "What are all the different things that contribute to [PROBLEM]? Which of these do you think is most important?"

3. **Exception Analysis**
   "Are there times when [ASSUMED CAUSE] is present but [PROBLEM] doesn't occur? What's different in those situations?"

4. **Intervention History**
   "What has been tried before to address [PROBLEM]? What worked, what didn't, and why do you think that was?"

#### Stakeholder Cause Attribution
**Assumption Category:** Different groups' perspectives on causes

1. **Perspective Comparison**
   "How do you think [OTHER STAKEHOLDER GROUP] would explain why [PROBLEM] exists? Do you agree with that explanation?"

2. **Blame vs. Cause Separation**
   "Some people say [PROBLEM] is caused by [CONTESTED CAUSE]. What do you think about that? What evidence do you see?"

3. **Historical Context**
   "How long has [PROBLEM] been an issue here? What do older community members say about when and how it started?"

### 🌿 Effects Validation Questions

#### Impact Verification
**Assumption Category:** Problem consequences and effects

1. **Personal Impact Stories**
   "How has [PROBLEM] changed things for you personally? For your family? For your work or daily life?"

2. **Community Impact Observation**
   "What changes have you noticed in the community because of [PROBLEM]? What's different now compared to before?"

3. **Ripple Effect Mapping**
   "When [PROBLEM] affects one family, how does that impact others? Can you give me an example?"

4. **Hidden Consequences**
   "Are there effects of [PROBLEM] that people don't usually talk about or that outsiders might not see?"

## 🎭 Stakeholder-Specific Question Design

### Questions for Affected Populations

#### Experience-Centered Questions
**Focus:** Personal stories, daily impact, coping strategies
**Tone:** Respectful, non-judgmental, empowering

**Examples:**
- "What does a typical day look like when [PROBLEM] is affecting you?"
- "What strategies have you developed to deal with [PROBLEM]?"
- "If you could change one thing about [PROBLEM SITUATION], what would it be?"
- "What do people outside this community not understand about [PROBLEM]?"

### Questions for Service Providers

#### System-Level Questions
**Focus:** Service delivery, policy implementation, resource constraints
**Tone:** Professional, collaborative, solution-oriented

**Examples:**
- "From your perspective providing [SERVICES], what are the main barriers your clients face?"
- "How has [PROBLEM] evolved in terms of the cases you see?"
- "What would need to change in the system for you to be more effective?"
- "Where do you see gaps between policy/programs and what actually happens?"

### Questions for Decision Makers
