## 📋 The Universal Problem Tree Template

### Core Structure
```
🌿 EFFECTS (What happens because of the problem?)
├── Primary Effect 1: Immediate consequence
├── Primary Effect 2: Direct impact on beneficiaries  
└── Secondary Effects: Long-term systemic impacts

🌳 CORE PROBLEM (The central issue)
Clear, specific, measurable problem statement

🌱 ROOT CAUSES (Why does the problem exist?)
├── Direct Cause 1: Immediate factors
├── Direct Cause 2: Proximate drivers
└── Underlying Causes: Systemic factors
```

### Problem Statement Formula
**[Specific population] + [experiences/lacks] + [specific condition] + [in defined context] + [with measurable indicator]**

**Example:** 
"Rural women farmers in Western Kenya experience 40% lower crop yields due to limited access to improved seeds and agricultural training, affecting 15,000 households across 50 villages."

## 🏥 Health Sector Example

### Problem Tree: Maternal Mortality in Rural Areas

**🌿 EFFECTS**
- High infant mortality rates (secondary)
- Reduced family economic productivity (secondary)
- Increased healthcare costs for emergency interventions (primary)
- Psychological trauma for families and communities (primary)

**🌳 CORE PROBLEM**
Pregnant women in rural Malawi have limited access to skilled birth attendants, resulting in maternal mortality rate of 349 deaths per 100,000 live births - 3x the national average.

**🌱 ROOT CAUSES**
- **Direct Causes:**
  - Shortage of trained midwives in rural health centers
  - Long distances to nearest health facility (average 15km)
  - Lack of transportation for emergency cases
  
- **Underlying Causes:**
  - Limited government health budget allocation to rural areas
  - Cultural preference for traditional birth attendants
  - Weak referral system between community and hospital levels

### Key Insights from This Example
- **Specific population**: Pregnant women in rural Malawi
- **Measurable problem**: 349 deaths per 100,000 live births
- **Context**: Rural areas with limited health infrastructure
- **Clear cause-effect logic**: Shows how structural issues lead to preventable deaths

## 🎓 Education Sector Example

### Problem Tree: Youth Unemployment Due to Skills Gap

**🌿 EFFECTS**
- Increased youth migration to urban areas (secondary)
- Social instability and crime rates (secondary)
- Lost economic productivity (primary)
- Youth frustration and disengagement (primary)

**🌳 CORE PROBLEM**
Recent graduates in Eastern Uganda lack job-relevant skills, with 68% of youth aged 18-25 unemployed despite completing secondary education.

**🌱 ROOT CAUSES**
- **Direct Causes:**
  - Outdated curriculum not aligned with market needs
  - Limited practical skills training in schools
  - Weak connections between schools and employers
  
- **Underlying Causes:**
  - Rapid economic transformation without education system adaptation
  - Limited private sector engagement in curriculum development
  - Inadequate teacher training on modern skills requirements

## 🌍 Environmental Sector Example

### Problem Tree: Deforestation in Community Forest

**🌿 EFFECTS**
- Increased soil erosion and crop failures (primary)
- Loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services (primary)
- Reduced water quality and availability (secondary)
- Increased vulnerability to climate change (secondary)

**🌳 CORE PROBLEM**
Community forest in Northern Colombia has lost 35% of tree cover in past 5 years due to unsustainable logging and agricultural expansion.

**🌱 ROOT CAUSES**
- **Direct Causes:**
  - Illegal logging for commercial timber sales
  - Slash-and-burn agriculture by migrant farmers
  - Limited enforcement of forest protection regulations
  
- **Underlying Causes:**
  - Lack of alternative livelihood options for community members
  - Weak governance and corruption in forest management
  - Market demand for cheap timber and agricultural products

## 💰 Economic Development Example

### Problem Tree: Limited Access to Credit for Small Businesses

**🌿 EFFECTS**
- Reduced business growth and job creation (primary)
- Perpetuation of poverty cycles (secondary)
- Limited economic diversification (secondary)
- Increased inequality between rural and urban areas (secondary)

**🌳 CORE PROBLEM**
Small business owners in rural Bangladesh cannot access appropriate credit, with only 23% having access to formal financial services compared to 58% in urban areas.

**🌱 ROOT CAUSES**
- **Direct Causes:**
  - High collateral requirements from formal banks
  - Complex application processes and documentation
  - Limited financial literacy among business owners
  
- **Underlying Causes:**
  - Banks' risk-averse approach to rural lending
  - Weak credit scoring systems for informal businesses
  - Limited financial infrastructure in rural areas

## 🛠️ Template Customization Guide

### Step 1: Define Your Context
- **Geographic scope**: Country, region, community level
- **Time frame**: How recent is your data?
- **Population**: Who specifically is affected?
- **Scale**: How many people/what area?

### Step 2: Research Your Problem
- **Quantitative data**: Statistics, surveys, official reports
- **Qualitative insights**: Interviews, focus groups, observations
- **Secondary sources**: Academic research, government reports, NGO studies
- **Stakeholder perspectives**: Different viewpoints on the same issue

### Step 3: Structure Your Analysis
1. Start with the **core problem** - write it clearly and specifically
2. Work **downward** to identify root causes (ask "why" repeatedly)
3. Work **upward** to identify effects (ask "what happens because of this")
4. **Validate** each connection - can you prove the causal relationship?

### Step 4: Quality Check
- Is each element **specific** and **measurable**?
- Do the **causal connections** make logical sense?
- Have you **separated symptoms** from root causes?
- Is there **evidence** to support each element?
