# 🌳 Problem Tree Analysis

Break down complex social challenges into clear root causes, core problems, and effects using systematic methodology enhanced with strategic AI-assisted research.

---

## 🎯 Master Problem Tree Analysis

This comprehensive toolkit helps you **clarify the root causes, core problem, and consequences** of a key challenge in your project design. Whether you're tackling health issues, education gaps, environmental challenges, or economic development, problem tree analysis provides the foundation for everything from activities to budgets to impact measurement.

### 🌟 Why Problem Tree Analysis Matters

**The Problem with Most Social Impact Projects:**
- Vague problem definition → Unfocused solutions
- Assumption-based planning → Solutions that miss the mark  
- Weak evidence base → Unconvincing proposals
- Skip community validation → Projects that don't resonate

**What Problem Tree Analysis Provides:**
- **Clarity** on what problem you're really solving
- **Logic** that connects causes to problems to effects
- **Evidence base** that supports your intervention choices
- **Stakeholder questions** that guide meaningful community engagement
