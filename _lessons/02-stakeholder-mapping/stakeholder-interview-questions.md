## üîó From Problem Tree to Powerful Questions

### Connecting to Your Assumptions
Each assumption (A) from your [Problem Tree Analysis](../../problem-tree-analysis/) needs validation through carefully crafted questions. Poor questions lead to poor data - this guide helps you ask questions that unlock real understanding.

### The Validation Framework
Transform your Problem Tree elements into exploration themes:
- **Root Causes** ‚Üí "Help me understand why..."
- **Core Problem** ‚Üí "Tell me about your experience with..."
- **Effects** ‚Üí "What happens when..."

## üéØ Universal Opening Questions

### Building Rapport and Context
These questions work across all stakeholder types to open conversations:

**Ice Breakers:**
- "Tell me a bit about yourself and your connection to [issue/community]"
- "How long have you been involved with [issue/organization/community]?"
- "What's a typical day like for you regarding [relevant context]?"

**Context Setting:**
- "What changes have you seen in [issue] over the past few years?"
- "How does [issue] show up in this community?"
- "When did you first become aware of [problem]?"

**Permission to Explore:**
- "What would be helpful for us to understand about [issue]?"
- "What questions should we be asking that we might not know to ask?"
- "What do outsiders often misunderstand about this situation?"

---

## üë• Questions by Stakeholder Type

### Primary Stakeholders (Directly Affected)

**Understanding Lived Experience:**
```
EFFECTIVE ‚úÖ
"Can you walk me through what happens when [problem occurs]?"
"What does [problem] mean for your daily life?"
"How do you currently manage/cope with [challenge]?"

INEFFECTIVE ‚ùå
"Don't you think [problem] is serious?" (leading)
"Why don't you just [simple solution]?" (judgmental)
"Is [problem] your biggest challenge?" (assumptive)
```

**Exploring Root Causes:**
```
EFFECTIVE ‚úÖ
"What makes this problem harder to solve here?"
"What would need to be different for this to improve?"
"What barriers do you face when trying to [desired action]?"

INEFFECTIVE ‚ùå
"Is it because of [single cause]?" (oversimplifying)
"Who's to blame for this?" (blame-focused)
"Don't you have [resource]?" (assumptive)
```

**Understanding Effects:**
```
EFFECTIVE ‚úÖ
"How does [problem] affect your family/work/community?"
"What opportunities have you missed because of [problem]?"
"What worries you most about the future if this continues?"

INEFFECTIVE ‚ùå
"You must be suffering a lot?" (presumptive)
"Doesn't this make you angry?" (emotional leading)
"How bad is it really?" (minimizing)
```

### Secondary Stakeholders (Influence/Expertise)

**Technical Validation:**
```
EFFECTIVE ‚úÖ
"Based on your expertise, what are we missing in our analysis?"
"What evidence have you seen that supports or challenges [assumption]?"
"What approaches have you seen work in similar contexts?"

INEFFECTIVE ‚ùå
"We think [solution], do you agree?" (confirmation seeking)
"Isn't [cause] the real problem?" (leading)
"You're the expert, what should we do?" (over-dependent)
```

**Resource and Partnership:**
```
EFFECTIVE ‚úÖ
"What role could your organization play in addressing this?"
"What resources or capabilities exist that aren't being utilized?"
"What would successful collaboration look like to you?"

INEFFECTIVE ‚ùå
"Can you fund our project?" (premature ask)
"Will you support whatever we decide?" (vague)
"Don't you think you should help?" (guilt-based)
```

### Tertiary Stakeholders (Broader Context)

**System Understanding:**
```
EFFECTIVE ‚úÖ
"How does [problem] connect to your area of work?"
"What indirect effects of [problem] do you observe?"
"Who else is working on related issues we should know about?"

INEFFECTIVE ‚ùå
"This isn't really your problem, is it?" (dismissive)
"You probably don't know much about this?" (assumptive)
"Can we count on your support?" (premature)
```

## üîç Deep Dive Question Techniques

### The Five Whys Technique
Start with a surface observation and dig deeper:

1. "Why do you think [problem] happens?"
   ‚Üí "Because [surface reason]"
2. "Why does [surface reason] occur?"
   ‚Üí "Because [deeper reason]"
3. "Why is [deeper reason] the case?"
   ‚Üí "Because [systemic reason]"
4. "Why does [systemic reason] exist?"
   ‚Üí "Because [root cause]"
5. "Why has [root cause] persisted?"
   ‚Üí "Because [fundamental issue]"

### The Critical Incident Technique
Explore specific examples for rich detail:

- "Can you tell me about the last time [problem] affected you?"
- "Walk me through exactly what happened"
- "What were you thinking/feeling at that moment?"
- "What did you do? What didn't you do? Why?"
- "Looking back, what would have helped?"

### The Appreciative Inquiry Approach
Focus on what works to understand what's possible:

- "Tell me about a time when this worked well"
- "What was different about that situation?"
- "What made success possible then?"
- "How could we create more of those conditions?"
- "What strengths exist that we could build on?"

---

## üí¨ Question Flow Strategies

### The Funnel Approach
Start broad and narrow down:

```
BROAD: "Tell me about healthcare in your community"
    ‚Üì
"What are the biggest challenges people face?"
    ‚Üì
"You mentioned distance to clinics - tell me more"
    ‚Üì
"How do pregnant women specifically manage this?"
    ‚Üì
SPECIFIC: "What happens during emergencies at night?"
```

### The Problem-Solution Bridge
Connect current state to desired future:

1. **Current State**: "How does [problem] work now?"
2. **Impact**: "What does this mean for you?"
3. **Ideal State**: "What would good look like?"
4. **Barriers**: "What prevents that from happening?"
5. **Opportunities**: "What could help bridge this gap?"

### The Stakeholder Web
Understand relationships and influences:

- "Who else is affected by this problem?"
- "Who has power to change this situation?"
- "Who influences the decision-makers?"
- "Who would oppose changes? Why?"
- "Who are your allies in addressing this?"

---

## üö´ Questions to Avoid

### Leading Questions
‚ùå "Don't you think corruption is the main problem?"  
‚úÖ "What factors contribute to this problem?"

‚ùå "Wouldn't education solve this?"  
‚úÖ "What role does education play?"

### Binary Questions
‚ùå "Is this a big problem?" (Yes/No)  
‚úÖ "How does this problem affect you?" (Open)

‚ùå "Do you support our approach?" (Yes/No)  
‚úÖ "What are your thoughts on this approach?" (Open)

### Loaded Questions
‚ùå "Why don't people care about this issue?"  
‚úÖ "How do different people view this issue?"

‚ùå "When will the government finally act?"  
‚úÖ "What role could government play?"

### Multiple Questions
‚ùå "What causes this, who's affected, and what should we do?"  
‚úÖ Ask one clear question at a time

### Jargon-Heavy Questions
‚ùå "What's your theory of change for systemic transformation?"  
‚úÖ "What changes would make the biggest difference?"

---

## üé≠ Cultural Adaptation

### Direct vs. Indirect Cultures

**Direct Culture Approach:**
- Clear, specific questions
- Direct attribution acceptable
- Okay to challenge/debate
- Time-efficient focus

**Indirect Culture Approach:**
- Softer, circular questions
- Third-person framing
- Respectful, non-confrontational
- Relationship before task

### Power Distance Considerations

**High Power Distance:**
- More formal language
- Acknowledge hierarchy
- Permission-seeking tone
- Defer to authority

**Low Power Distance:**
- Casual, peer-to-peer
- Challenge acceptable
- Collaborative tone
- Equal participation

### Individual vs. Collective

**Individual-Oriented:**
- "What do YOU think?"
- Personal experiences
- Individual impact
- Personal solutions

**Collective-Oriented:**
- "What does the community think?"
- Group experiences
- Community impact
- Collective solutions

## üí° Advanced Questioning Techniques

### When You Hit Resistance

**They say "I don't know":**
- "What's your best guess?"
- "What have you heard others say?"
- "If you had to explain to someone else?"

**They give vague answers:**
- "Can you give me a specific example?"
- "What did that look like in practice?"
- "Help me understand the details"

**They seem uncomfortable:**
- "We can skip this if you prefer"
- "Would you rather discuss something else?"
- "Is there a better way to ask this?"

### When You Need to Probe

**Clarification:**
- "What do you mean by [term]?"
- "Can you help me understand?"
- "I want to make sure I got this right..."

**Elaboration:**
- "Tell me more about that"
- "What else?"
- "And then what happened?"

**Examples:**
- "Can you give me an instance?"
- "When was the last time?"
- "What did that look like?"

### When You're Checking Understanding

**Summarizing:**
- "So if I understand correctly..."
- "Let me play back what I heard..."
- "The key points seem to be..."

**Verification:**
- "Did I capture that accurately?"
- "What did I miss?"
- "Is there more to add?"

## üì• Next Steps

After preparing your questions:

1. **Review cultural factors** using the [Cultural Considerations Guide](../stakeholder-cultural-considerations/)
2. **Practice active listening** techniques
3. **Prepare documentation** with the [Conversation Documentation Template](../stakeholder-documentation-template/)
4. **Test questions** with your team first
