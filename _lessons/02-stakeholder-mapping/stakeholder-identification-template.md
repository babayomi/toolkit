# 🎭 Stakeholder Identification Template

Systematically brainstorm and categorize all relevant stakeholders across primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. This template builds directly from your Problem Tree Analysis to identify who can validate, challenge, and enrich your understanding.

---

## 🔗 Building from Your Problem Tree

### Connect to Lesson 1.1
Remember those assumptions you marked with (A) in your [Problem Tree Analysis](../../problem-tree-analysis/)? Each assumption points to specific stakeholders who can provide validation:

**From Root Causes (A)** → Who understands why this problem exists?  
**From Core Problem (A)** → Who experiences this problem directly?  
**From Effects (A)** → Who sees the consequences of this problem?  

Use your Problem Tree as a stakeholder discovery map - every branch suggests people you need to engage.

### Primary Stakeholders (Directly Affected)
**Definition:** People who experience the problem directly or will be directly affected by your project outcomes.

**What they provide:**
- Lived experience and practical insights
- Understanding of daily realities and coping strategies
- Perspective on what solutions would actually work
- Cultural context and community dynamics

**Identification Prompts:**
- Who faces this problem every day?
- Who would benefit most if this problem were solved?
- Whose lives would change with your intervention?
- Who has been trying to cope with this problem?

### Secondary Stakeholders (Influence or Expertise)
**Definition:** People with significant power to influence outcomes, relevant expertise, or resources your project needs.

**What they provide:**
- Technical expertise and professional insights
- Institutional knowledge and historical context
- Access to resources, permissions, or partnerships
- Validation of your approach from credible sources

**Identification Prompts:**
- Who makes decisions about this issue?
- Who has tried to solve this before?
- Who controls relevant resources or budgets?
- Who has specialized knowledge about this problem?

### Tertiary Stakeholders (Indirect Interest)
**Definition:** People with some interest or influence but not central to your immediate project focus.

**What they provide:**
- Broader context and connections
- Potential future partnerships or support
- Understanding of wider system dynamics
- Awareness of potential unintended consequences

**Identification Prompts:**
- Who might be indirectly affected by changes?
- Who works on related but different issues?
- Who might become important later in the project?

## 📋 Stakeholder Identification Worksheet

### Step 1: Brainstorm Comprehensively

Use these sector-agnostic prompting questions to ensure you don't miss anyone:

```
WHO EXPERIENCES THE PROBLEM?
□ Direct victims/affected populations
□ Family members and caregivers
□ Community members in affected areas
□ Future generations who will inherit consequences

WHO HAS TRIED TO ADDRESS IT?
□ Other nonprofits and NGOs
□ Government programs and agencies
□ Community-based organizations
□ International development partners

WHO HAS POWER TO CHANGE IT?
□ Policy makers and legislators
□ Department heads and directors
□ Community leaders and elders
□ Funding organizations

WHO HAS EXPERTISE ABOUT IT?
□ Academic researchers
□ Technical specialists
□ Field practitioners
□ Traditional knowledge holders

WHO MIGHT OPPOSE SOLUTIONS?
□ Those who benefit from status quo
□ Competing interest groups
□ Those who fear change
□ Resource competitors

WHO COULD BE ALLIES?
□ Organizations with aligned missions
□ Champions within institutions
□ Community advocates
□ Media and influencers
```

### Step 2: Categorize Your Stakeholders

| Category | Stakeholder Name/Group | Specific Role | How to Reach | Validation They Can Provide |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **PRIMARY** | | | | |
| Example | Rural women farmers | Experience low yields | Village meetings | Validate causes of productivity gaps |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| **SECONDARY** | | | | |
| Example | Agricultural Extension Officer | Provides technical support | District office | Validate technical assumptions |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |
| **TERTIARY** | | | | |
| Example | Local media outlets | Cover agricultural issues | Email/phone | Context on public perception |
| | | | | |
| | | | | |

### Step 3: Map to Your Problem Tree Assumptions

For each assumption (A) in your Problem Tree, identify which stakeholders can validate it:

| Problem Tree Element | Assumption to Validate | Relevant Stakeholders | Validation Method |
|---|---|---|---|
| Root Cause | Limited access to credit | Microfinance institutions, farmers | Interviews, loan data |
| Core Problem | 40% yield reduction | Farmers, extension officers | Field measurements, records |
| Effect | Reduced household income | Families, local markets | Household surveys |

## ✅ Quality Check for Stakeholder Identification

### Diversity Assessment
- [ ] Have you included different genders, ages, and abilities?
- [ ] Are marginalized voices represented?
- [ ] Do you have both supporters and potential critics?
- [ ] Have you considered different geographic areas?

### Completeness Check
- [ ] Did you identify stakeholders for each Problem Tree assumption?
- [ ] Have you included decision-makers at different levels?
- [ ] Are there stakeholders who could block your project if not engaged?
- [ ] Did you consider indirect beneficiaries and those negatively affected?

### Relationship Mapping
- [ ] Do you understand existing relationships between stakeholders?
- [ ] Have you identified potential conflicts of interest?
- [ ] Are there natural allies you could bring together?
- [ ] Do you know who influences whom?

## 💡 Pro Tips for Stakeholder Identification

### Avoid Common Blind Spots
1. **The Invisible Stakeholders:** Those who are affected but have no voice (future generations, non-human life, the extremely marginalized)
2. **The Unexpected Opposition:** Those who might lose power, resources, or status if your project succeeds
3. **The Hidden Influencers:** Behind-the-scenes decision makers, traditional authorities, informal leaders
4. **The Service Providers:** Those who currently provide (inadequate) solutions and might see you as competition

### Use Snowball Identification
At the end of every stakeholder conversation, ask:
- "Who else should we be talking to about this?"
- "Who really understands this issue?"
- "Who has the power to make changes?"
- "Who might have a different perspective?"

### Consider Stakeholder Evolution
Stakeholders can shift categories over time:
- Low interest can become high interest when they see benefits
- Tertiary stakeholders might become primary if project scope expands
- Opponents can become allies with proper engagement
- Plan for these shifts in your engagement strategy

## 📥 Next Steps

After completing your stakeholder identification:

1. **Move to the [Power-Interest Analysis Grid](../stakeholder-power-interest-grid/)** to prioritize your engagement
2. **Revisit your Problem Tree** to ensure all assumptions have corresponding stakeholders
3. **Begin planning your engagement approach** using the [Engagement Planning Worksheet](../stakeholder-engagement-planning/)
4. **Prepare your questions** using the [Interview Question Bank](../stakeholder-interview-questions/)

---

*Remember: Stakeholder identification is iterative. As you engage with initial stakeholders, they'll help you identify others you may have missed. Keep your stakeholder map as a living document throughout your project.*
