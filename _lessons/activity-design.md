# Activity Design: From Outcomes to Action

Design meaningful, measurable activities that directly connect to your outcomes, are logically sequenced for maximum impact, and make efficient use of available resources.

## üéØ What You'll Learn

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

‚úÖ **Design activities** that directly contribute to your intended outcomes  
‚úÖ **Sequence activities** logically for maximum impact and efficiency  
‚úÖ **Calculate resource requirements** realistically for each activity  
‚úÖ **Build in quality assurance** measures and learning opportunities  
‚úÖ **Create implementation timelines** that account for dependencies and risks

## üéØ Principles of Good Activity Design

### Activities Should Be:

**Outcome-Connected**
- Each activity contributes directly to at least one outcome
- Clear logic chain from activity ‚Üí output ‚Üí outcome
- Remove activities that don't serve your objectives

**Participant-Centered** 
- Designed around beneficiary needs and preferences
- Accessible to your target population
- Culturally appropriate and contextually relevant

**Evidence-Based**
- Built on proven approaches and best practices
- Adapted to your specific context and constraints
- Include innovation only when justified by evidence

**Resource-Realistic**
- Achievable within your budget and timeline constraints  
- Make efficient use of available staff and partnerships
- Account for all direct and indirect costs

**Measurable**
- Clear outputs that can be counted or assessed
- Quality standards that can be evaluated
- Contribute to indicator measurement for your logframe

## üîó Connecting Activities to Outcomes

### The Activity-Outcome Logic Chain

```
ACTIVITIES ‚Üí OUTPUTS ‚Üí OUTCOMES ‚Üí IMPACT
     ‚Üì         ‚Üì         ‚Üì        ‚Üì
What we do ‚Üí What we ‚Üí Changes ‚Üí Long-term
           produce   that result   transformation
```

### Example Logic Chain: Youth Employment Project

**Outcome:** "Youth develop job-relevant skills and find employment"

**Activities:**
1. **Skills assessment and career counseling**
   - Output: Individual development plans created
   - Logic: Understanding current skills and career goals

2. **Technical skills training workshops**
   - Output: Youth complete certification programs  
   - Logic: Building specific skills employers need

3. **Job placement support and networking**
   - Output: Youth connected with employers
   - Logic: Bridging skills to actual employment opportunities

4. **Follow-up mentoring and support**
   - Output: Ongoing guidance provided
   - Logic: Ensuring successful transition and retention

## üìã Activity Design Framework

### Step 1: Start with Outcomes (Work Backwards)

**For Each Outcome, Ask:**
- What specific changes need to happen?
- Who needs to change (knowledge, skills, behavior)?
- What conditions need to be created?
- What barriers need to be removed?

### Step 2: Identify Required Outputs

**Bridge from Outcomes to Activities:**
- What products/services will create these changes?
- What experiences do participants need?
- What information or tools must be provided?
- What relationships or connections are essential?

### Step 3: Design Specific Activities

**Activity Planning Questions:**
- **What exactly will happen?** (Detailed description)
- **Who will participate?** (Target numbers and demographics)
- **Who will lead/facilitate?** (Staff, partners, experts)
- **When and how often?** (Schedule and frequency)
- **Where will it take place?** (Location and setup requirements)
- **What resources are needed?** (Materials, equipment, space)

## ‚è∞ Activity Sequencing and Timing

### Logical Sequencing Principles

**Prerequisites First**
- Foundation knowledge before advanced skills
- Trust building before sensitive topics
- Basic services before specialized interventions

**Progressive Complexity**
- Start with simple, achievable activities
- Build confidence through early wins
- Gradually increase challenge and responsibility

**Seasonal and Context Considerations**
- Agricultural cycles for rural programs
- School calendars for education projects
- Cultural and religious observances
- Weather and accessibility factors

### Example Activity Sequence

**Youth Employment Program (12-month timeline):**

**Months 1-2: Foundation Phase**
- Recruitment and intake processes
- Skills assessment and career counseling
- Individual development plan creation

**Months 3-8: Skills Development Phase**
- Technical skills training (core curriculum)
- Soft skills and job readiness training
- Practical work experience or internships

**Months 9-11: Transition Phase**
- Job search support and networking
- Interview preparation and practice
- Employer engagement and matching

**Month 12+: Follow-up Phase**
- Post-placement support and mentoring
- Success tracking and troubleshooting
- Alumni network development

## üí∞ Resource Planning for Activities

### Resource Categories

**Human Resources**
- Staff time (planning, facilitating, follow-up)
- Expert consultants and facilitators
- Volunteer coordination and support
- Participant stipends or incentives

**Material Resources**
- Training materials and supplies
- Equipment and technology needs
- Venue rental and setup costs
- Transportation and logistics

**Operational Resources**
- Communication and marketing costs
- Administrative and coordination expenses
- Monitoring and documentation costs
- Contingency funds for unexpected needs

### Resource Calculation Template

**For Each Activity:**

| Resource Type | Quantity | Unit Cost | Total Cost | Notes |
|---------------|----------|-----------|------------|-------|
| Facilitator (2 days) | 2 | $200/day | $400 | External expert |
| Venue rental | 1 | $150/day | $150 | Community center |
| Materials | 25 participants | $10/person | $250 | Workbooks & supplies |
| Refreshments | 25 participants | $8/person | $200 | Lunch & breaks |
| **Activity Total** | | | **$1,000** | |

## üìä Quality Assurance and Learning

### Built-in Quality Measures

**Pre-Activity Quality Checks**
- Participant preparation and prerequisites met
- Facilitator training and material preparation
- Venue and logistics confirmed
- Clear objectives and success criteria defined

**During-Activity Monitoring**
- Participation levels and engagement
- Learning objectives being met
- Any barriers or challenges emerging
- Participant feedback and satisfaction

**Post-Activity Evaluation**
- Knowledge or skill gains achieved
- Behavior change intentions expressed
- Follow-up needs and commitments identified
- Lessons learned for improvement

### Continuous Improvement Process

**After Each Activity:**
1. **Immediate debrief** with facilitators and key participants
2. **Document lessons learned** and improvement opportunities
3. **Update activity design** for future iterations
4. **Share insights** with team and stakeholders
5. **Apply learnings** to subsequent activities
