# ‚úÖ Quality Assurance Checklist

Evaluation criteria to ensure your engagement is meaningful, diverse, and generating genuine insights. Use this checklist to assess whether your stakeholder engagement is adding real value to your [Problem Tree Analysis](../../problem-tree-analysis/).

---

## üéØ Quality Engagement vs. Box-Checking

### The Difference That Matters

**Box-Checking Engagement:**
- Talks to predetermined list of "usual suspects"
- Asks questions that confirm existing assumptions
- Rushes through conversations to meet targets
- Documents names and numbers, not insights
- Treats engagement as one-time extraction

**Quality Engagement:**
- Discovers unexpected but important voices
- Challenges and refines original assumptions
- Builds relationships through respectful process
- Captures nuanced insights and contradictions
- Creates ongoing learning partnerships

### Why Quality Matters

Poor stakeholder engagement is worse than no engagement because it:
- Creates false confidence in flawed analysis
- Damages relationships with communities
- Wastes limited time and resources
- Reduces credibility with funders
- Leads to ineffective project design

## üí° Quality Enhancement Tips

### Micro-Improvements That Make Big Differences

**During Conversations:**
- Repeat back what you heard to verify understanding
- Ask "What else?" three times before moving topics
- Notice and inquire about non-verbal communication
- Thank people for specific insights they shared
- Ask "What questions should I have asked that I didn't?"

**Between Conversations:**
- Call stakeholders to clarify points you didn't understand
- Send photos/videos of visual aids they created
- Connect stakeholders to resources you promised
- Share relevant findings from other conversations (with permission)
- Follow up on commitments within 48 hours

**In Analysis:**
- Look for minority opinions that might be important
- Map stakeholder relationships and influences
- Identify gaps in perspective or representation
- Test interpretations with cultural insiders
- Create feedback loops with engaged stakeholders

## üì• Next Steps After Quality Assessment

Based on your quality score and identified gaps:

**High Quality (18-20 points):**
1. Document best practices for replication
2. Share lessons with other organizations
3. Move forward to [Pro Tips](../stakeholder-pro-tips/) for advanced strategies
4. Plan second round of engagement for deeper validation

**Medium Quality (12-17 points):**
1. Address specific gaps identified in scoring
2. Seek additional training or consultation
3. Plan targeted additional conversations
4. Review and apply [Pro Tips](../stakeholder-pro-tips/) selectively

**Low Quality (Below 12 points):**
1. Stop and reassess entire approach
2. Seek external consultation and support
3. Apologize and repair any damaged relationships
4. Restart with revised strategy and timeline

*Remember: Quality stakeholder engagement takes time and skill to develop. Every conversation is an opportunity to practice and improve. The goal is not perfection, but continuous learning and relationship building that strengthens your project design.*
