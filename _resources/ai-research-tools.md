## üìä Sample MCP Template: Problem Analysis

### Complete Template Structure

```
# MCP Template: Comprehensive Problem Analysis

## CONTEXT SETTING
You are a research analyst specializing in [SECTOR] issues in [GEOGRAPHIC REGION]. 
Your task is to conduct comprehensive analysis of [SPECIFIC PROBLEM] to inform 
project design and funding applications.

## RESEARCH PARAMETERS
- Time frame: Focus on data from past 5 years, with historical context where relevant
- Geographic scope: [SPECIFIC COUNTRIES/REGIONS]
- Population focus: [TARGET DEMOGRAPHICS]
- Evidence standards: Prioritize peer-reviewed research, government reports, 
  and credible NGO/international organization publications

## ANALYSIS QUERIES

### Root Cause Analysis
1. "What are the primary root causes of [PROBLEM] in [REGION]? Provide evidence 
   from multiple sources and distinguish between proximate and distal causes."

2. "What are the most significant contributing factors that research has identified? 
   Rank these by strength of evidence and impact magnitude."

3. "What historical, political, economic, and social factors have shaped this 
   problem over time?"

### Current State Assessment
4. "What is the current scale and scope of [PROBLEM]? Provide specific statistics 
   and metrics where available."

5. "Which populations are most affected? Provide demographic breakdowns and 
   vulnerability analysis."

6. "How has this problem changed over the past 5 years? Include trend analysis 
   and projection implications."

### Intervention Landscape
7. "What interventions are currently being implemented to address this problem? 
   Evaluate their effectiveness based on available evidence."

8. "What gaps exist in current response efforts? What approaches haven't been tried?"

9. "What are the key barriers preventing effective solutions?"

### Evidence Synthesis
10. "Synthesize this information into key themes. What patterns emerge across different 
    sources and perspectives?"

11. "What assumptions or biases might influence how this problem is understood? 
    Present alternative perspectives."

12. "What additional research or validation would strengthen understanding of this issue?"

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Please structure your response as:
- Executive Summary (200 words)
- Root Cause Analysis with evidence ratings

## üîç Quality Assurance for AI Research

### Verification Strategies

**Source Credibility Assessment**
- Cross-reference AI findings with known credible sources
- Look for peer-reviewed research citations
- Verify statistics with official databases
- Check for recent updates and current relevance

**Bias Detection and Mitigation**
- Ask AI to identify potential biases in research
- Seek alternative perspectives and counter-arguments
- Include voices from affected communities
- Consider historical and power dynamics

**Evidence Strength Evaluation**
- Distinguish between correlation and causation
- Assess sample sizes and methodology quality
- Consider geographical and temporal relevance
- Note limitations and confidence levels

### Common AI Research Pitfalls

**Over-Reliance on AI Outputs**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem: Accepting AI research without validation
- ‚úÖ Solution: Use AI as starting point, verify key claims independently

**Confirmation Bias in Prompting**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem: Asking questions that confirm existing assumptions
- ‚úÖ Solution: Include prompts that actively seek disconfirming evidence

**Context Misalignment**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Problem: Applying global research to specific local contexts
- ‚úÖ Solution: Always include local context validation and stakeholder input
