# ‚≠ê Quality Assurance Checklist for Literature Review

Systematic approach to reviewing and validating research sources for your problem analysis. Ensure your problem tree rests on solid evidence by applying rigorous quality standards to all research inputs.

---

## üéØ Why Quality Assurance Matters

### The Cost of Poor Research Quality
- **Weak foundations** lead to ineffective interventions
- **Biased sources** create solutions that don't work for everyone
- **Outdated information** misses current realities
- **Poor methodology** produces unreliable conclusions
- **Funding rejection** due to unconvincing evidence base

### The Value of Quality Research
- **Credible proposals** that funders trust
- **Effective interventions** based on solid evidence
- **Stakeholder confidence** in your analysis
- **Adaptable solutions** that work across contexts
- **Learning foundation** for continuous improvement

## üåç Context and Relevance Assessment

### Geographic Relevance Matrix

| Context Match Level | Use Guidelines | Adaptation Required |
|---|---|---|
| **Same Country/Region** | Direct application of findings | Minimal - check for demographic match |
| **Similar Development Level** | Cautious application | Moderate - consider institutional differences |
| **Same Income Category** | Hypothesis generation | High - validate all assumptions locally |
| **Different Context** | Conceptual insights only | Complete - use only for framework ideas |

### Temporal Relevance Guidelines

#### Fast-Changing Contexts (Technology, Policy, Urban)
- **Within 2 years**: Direct application
- **2-5 years**: Use with caution, verify current relevance
- **5+ years**: Background only, seek recent updates

#### Slow-Changing Contexts (Rural, Cultural, Structural)
- **Within 5 years**: Direct application
- **5-10 years**: Good with context checking
- **10+ years**: Use for historical perspective only

### Population Relevance Assessment
- [ ] **Demographic match**: Age, gender, income, education levels similar
- [ ] **Cultural context**: Same or similar cultural, linguistic, religious background
- [ ] **Urban/rural match**: Settlement type and infrastructure level similar
- [ ] **Economic context**: Similar livelihood patterns and economic constraints
- [ ] **Political context**: Similar governance structures and civic participation

## üìã Research Synthesis Quality Control

### Evidence Triangulation

#### Source Type Triangulation
- [ ] **Academic research** provides theoretical foundation
- [ ] **Government data** provides official statistics and policy context
- [ ] **NGO reports** provide field-based insights and practitioner perspective
- [ ] **Community voices** provide lived experience and validation

#### Method Triangulation  
- [ ] **Quantitative data** provides scale and statistical relationships
- [ ] **Qualitative insights** provide context and causal understanding
- [ ] **Mixed methods** studies combine both approaches
- [ ] **Longitudinal data** provides trend analysis and temporal patterns

#### Perspective Triangulation
- [ ] **Multiple stakeholder perspectives** represented
- [ ] **Different theoretical approaches** considered
- [ ] **Contrary evidence** acknowledged and addressed
- [ ] **Competing explanations** evaluated

### Bias Detection and Mitigation

#### Common Research Biases to Watch For
**Selection Bias:**
- Studies only include people who volunteered or were easy to reach
- Missing perspectives from marginalized or hard-to-reach populations
- Dropout patterns that skew results

**Publication Bias:**
- Only positive results get published
- Negative or null findings are underrepresented
- Industry-funded studies show consistently positive results

**Confirmation Bias:**
- Researchers interpret ambiguous results to support their hypothesis
- Cherry-picking data that supports predetermined conclusions
- Ignoring contradictory evidence

**Cultural Bias:**
- Research frameworks developed in one cultural context applied universally
- Measurement tools that don't account for cultural differences
- Researcher assumptions about "normal" or "desirable" behaviors

#### Bias Mitigation Strategies
1. **Actively seek contradictory evidence** - look for studies that challenge your assumptions
2. **Include diverse perspectives** - ensure multiple stakeholder voices in your analysis
3. **Check funding sources** - note who funded studies and potential conflicts of interest
4. **Look for replication** - findings supported by multiple independent studies
5. **Consider alternative explanations** - what else could explain the patterns you're seeing

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Apply quality assessment** to sources you've already collected
2. **Identify evidence gaps** that need additional research or stakeholder input
3. **Document quality limitations** that should be disclosed in proposals
4. **Continue to [üéØ Assumptions to Questions](../assumptions-to-questions/)** to prepare stakeholder validation
5. **Plan additional research** to fill critical quality gaps

*Quality research is the foundation of effective development work. It's better to acknowledge limitations honestly than to build on shaky evidence. Rigorous quality control at this stage saves time, resources, and credibility later.*
